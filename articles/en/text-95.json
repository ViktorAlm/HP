The daughter of an educated man, in the course of conversation with a brother\nor male acquaintance, raises the possibility that newly\nenfranchised women should now be admitted to all professions, including those still reserved for men:\nWe on our side of the table become aware at once of some\n‘strong emotion’ on your side ‘arising from some motive below\nthe level of conscious thought’…; a glance at the private psychometer shows that the emotional temperature has risen from\nten to twenty degrees above normal.\nWoolf was not present at the proceedings of the departmental committee convened by the British Foreign Office\nin 1934 to consider women’s suitability for diplomatic\ncareers. Had she been, she would have felt little need to\nreconsider her analysis of the masculine instinct to preserve its professional privileges.\nThe strength of feeling on the part of men in the Foreign Office stemmed from the perceived threat posed by\nwomen diplomats to the social and sexual order underpinning the modern diplomatic profession. In the 19th\ncentury, diplomacy evolved into a well-defined career for\nelite men accompanied by dutiful and loyal spouses. By\nthe interwar years, women were employed as typists and\nin lower-grade clerical roles in embassies, but never as the\nprofessional equals of men.\nThis state of affairs clearly suited Foreign Office authorities, who only reluctantly agreed to consider the possibility of appointing female diplomats following pressure from\nfeminists and professional women’s societies. The head of\nthe Foreign Office, Sir Robert Vansittart, made his position clear. Such a move ‘would not be in the interests of\nthe women themselves, nor in the interest of His Majesty’s\nService; and it would be damaging to the prestige of His\nMajesty’s Government in foreign countries’. In 1933, Vansittart handed the task of preparing the Foreign Office case to\nan assistant under-secretary, Charles Howard Smith, who\nswiftly pledged to gather ‘all the ammunition I can get’.\nThis did not prove difficult. Of 51 ambassadors canvassed for their opinions, only three were in favour of\nemploying women. The heads of the Consular Service,\nwhose officers worked in less salubrious surroundings in\nremote outposts or port towns, were even more emphatically opposed.\nTheir combined evidence advanced three main arguments. The first dwelt on the practical difficulties of\nposting women to countries where their status was low.\nIn Vansittart’s words: ‘It is a false argument to say that,\nbecause women are treated as equals in this country, an\nEnglishwoman abroad will be so treated by foreigners. She\nwill not.’ The Ambassador to Berlin, Sir Eric Phipps, reinforced the point, noting that Nazi officials ‘would probably feel that they themselves were not being taken sufficiently seriously for being asked to receive her’.\nThe second argument centred on the rough and tumble\nof ports, where consular officers could be called upon to\nplacate violent and inebriated sailors, deal with outbreaks\nof venereal disease on merchant ships, or investigate allegations of ‘homosexual crime’ at sea. Such tasks were\n‘obviously’ unsuitable for women.\nThe third argument focused on marital status. A single\nwoman, it was suggested, was of dramatically lower value\nthan a male diplomat, who came with a spouse in tow.\nThe Ambassador to Buenos Aires, Sir Henry Chilton,\nspeculated that ‘a femme sole as Ambassadress would do\nno more than 50 per cent of the work done by my wife\nand myself’. Conversely, a married woman presented the\nthorny problem of the diplomatic husband: if he shunned\nthe part of trailing spouse, then her resignation became\ninevitable but, if he accompanied her en poste, the chances\nwere he would quickly make himself a nuisance to the\nwork of the embassy.\nIn 1934 the committee found in favour of maintaining\nthe status quo, yet just over a decade later women were\nrepresenting Britain as diplomats in their own right. What\nhappened to effect this dramatic reversal? Put simply, the\nanswer was the war. Manpower shortages forced the Foreign Office, alongside other Whitehall departments, to\npost women overseas to carry out responsible political\nwork. Their professional competence destroyed much of\nthe Foreign Office case against women, while the sacrifices\nof ordinary women on the home front made it impossible\nto deny renewed feminist demands for equality in all areas\nof public life, including that of diplomacy.\nWoolf’s psychometer, however, still ran high even after\n1946. Alongside a marriage bar, which stayed in place until\n1973, postwar female recruits encountered hostile department heads in London and were denied overseas postings\nby sceptical ambassadors. The Foreign Office today is a far\nmore welcoming place, yet women remain outnumbered\nby men in the most senior grades to the level of three to\none. The battle for the Foreign Office may be over, but it\nis not yet history.\nHelen McCarthy, History Today", "id": ""}
