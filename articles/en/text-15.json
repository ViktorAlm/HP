What can be concluded about the marshmallow test from the closing paragraph?"], "article": "The Marshmallow Test\nThe great Russian writer Leo Tolstoy was a man of ferocious complexity and contradiction, of a scope that Walter Mischel could appreciate. Mischel, a professor of psychology at Columbia University, is a towering figure in\npersonality research, whose first popular book, The\nMarshmallow Test, summarizes his decades of work on\nself-control. It is also thanks to Mischel that we consider\nthe degree to which situation dictates behavior, and the\nfact that willpower – and much more – is only as predictable as the context in which it operates.\nHis so-called “marshmallow test,” first conducted at\nStanford University in the late 1960s, monitors the ability\nof a child to resist a treat when left alone with it. Mischel’s\nsubjects understood that they could eat the treat immediately if they rang a bell to summon the researcher, but\nthey’d receive two treats if they could await the researcher’s return. Four-year-old paragons of executive function\nwaited up to 15 minutes; school-age kids with “high delay\nskills” waited so long that Mischel himself could no longer\nstand to watch their heroic juvenile abnegation.\nThe test is noteworthy because long-term follow-up\nstudies show that a child’s ability to delay reward correlates with academic success and adult income, as well as\nwith affective powers such as the ability to tolerate stress\nand rejection. The “cooling” mental transformations that\nhelp a kid wait agonizing minutes to consume a marshmallow – imagining the candy is a cloud, putting a frame\naround it to make it abstract, etc. – are the bedrock processes that allow that same person to stay future-focused\nenough to earn a college degree or to reliably invest in a\nlong-term pension plan. Those with the ability to delay\nhave a well-oiled prefrontal cortex that successfully regulates their abstract thinking as well as impulse control.\nMainstream interest in Mischel’s work reflects our\nculture’s obsession with executive function or its lack\n(ADHD). We’re in the midst of a cognitive gold rush on\nself-control and grit, perhaps the two most valorized\nskills of our young century. Ironically, Mischel’s studies\nof personality, which are legendary among psychologists\nbut largely unknown to the public, suggest that there\nare natural checks on self-regulation. Self-control, like\nmost behaviors, is radically contingent. Character and\nwillpower bend depending on the environment and the\nindividual’s level of motivation.\nLeo Tolstoy was a maelstrom of lapses in his personal\nlife. He fought incessantly with his wife. He was critical and demanding of his family even as he preached a\nlove of humanity. This may surprise some people, but it\nwould not surprise Mischel. He argues that the key to\nexercising self-control and to understanding why people appear to behave erratically resides in the slimmest\nof phrases: if–then.\nFor example, the degree of conscientiousness we\nbring to a task at our job does not predict how conscientious we’ll be about bill paying or interacting with loved\nones when we arrive home. However, it is predictive of\nhow conscientious we’ll continue to be in work-related\nendeavors.\nMischel proposes that personality inscribes itself in\nif–then behavioral patterns, which “characterize most\npeople when their behavior is closely examined.” Further, “the behavioral signature of personality specifies\nwhat the individual does predictably if particular situational triggers occur. These behavioral triggers have\nbeen found with adults as well as children and for everything from conscientiousness and sociability to anxiety and stress.”\nPerhaps an omniscient biographer could map the intricate if–then patterns in Tolstoy’s life, as scattered as constellations in the night sky but ultimately just as predictable. We are, each of us, that complicated.\nMischel has said that he is most interested in the subjects who “failed” the marshmallow test but went on to\nsucceed in life. There’s no way to know whether Tolstoy\nwould fit the bill, but if so, Mischel would have an idea why.\nKaja Perina, Psychology Today", "id": ""}
