Like language, religion and music, stories are found in all cultures; they are\npart of what makes us human. Much of our conscious\nthought takes the form of an internal narrative in which\nwe try to understand ourselves and our actions. We tell\nstories to make sense of the world, to communicate, and\nto influence and manipulate other people.\nNew researchers’ efforts are starting to reveal how stories affect us mentally and physically. As well as throwing\nnew light on human psychology, their discoveries have\npractical potential.\nThe neuroscientist Michael Gazzangia has shown that\nthe left hemisphere is specialised for interpreting our\nfeelings, actions and experiences in the form of narrative.\nWe also seem to use storytelling to reconcile our conscious\nand subconscious thoughts – as, for example, when we\nmake choices based on subconscious reasoning and then\ninvent fictions to justify and rationalise them.\n Given the central role of internal narratives in human\npsychology, it is hardly surprising that stories told by other\npeople also have a hold on us. In fact, the two modes of\nstorytelling have a great deal in common. It would appear\nthat we don’t just tell stories to make sense of ourselves;\nwe actually adopt the stories of others as though we were\nthe protagonist.\nBrain-scanning research seems to confirm this. When\na research team of Washington University, Missouri, ran\nfunctional magnetic resonance imaging scans on people\nreading a story or watching a movie, they found that the\nsame brain regions that are active in real-life situations fire\nup when a fictitious character encounters an equivalent\nsituation. What is more, the brain responds in the same\nway whether the story is in the form of words on a page\nor a realistic action video. The mental mechanisms evolved\nover millennia to interpret a spoken story seem to have no\nproblem adapting to new media.\nStories can also manipulate how you feel, as anyone\nwho has watched a horror movie or read a Charles Dickens novel will confirm. But what makes us empathise so\nstrongly with fictional characters? Paul Zak from Claremont Graduate University, California, thinks the key is\noxytocin, a hormone produced during feel-good encounters. As a pioneer in oxytocin research, Zak has developed\nvarious ways to stimulate its release. The most potent so\nfar is an emotionally charged story. Getting volunteers to\nwatch a 5-minute video telling the story of a 4-year-old\nboy with terminal brain cancer increased oxytocin levels\nan average 47 per cent compared with others, who saw an\nemotionally neutral film about the same boy going to the\nzoo. The change in oxytocin correlated with their degree\nof empathy.\nWhether or not stories are processed in the reward\ncentres, there is no doubt that we can become engrossed\nin them at the expense of other more pressing activities.\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, this suggests narrative\nmust have some survival benefits. So what might these be?\nOne reason may be that stories allow us to try out ideas\nand imagine what might happen if we made different,\nperhaps more risky, choices. Another possibility is that\nstories act as social glue, binding people together in a common identity that is forged as they share the ideas and\nemotions prompted by narratives. Supporting this idea,\nUri Hasson of Princeton University has found the same\npattern of neural activity in different people watching the\nsame movie.\nStories are also good for pure escapism, of course. Some\nmovies suppress activity in regions of the brain usually\nengaged when we think about ourselves – including our\npast experiences and future plans. That is why engaging\nfiction is so appealing to us. It is doing a good job in absorbing us but not harming us.\nJessica Marshall, New Scientist", "id": ""}
