Infant Mortality One of the happiest trends of the first years of this century has been a dramatic decline in infant mortality. In 2013, approximately 6.3m children under the age of five died around the world, down from 9.7m in 2000. Achieving a two-thirds decline from 1990 mortality rates (when 12.7m children aged five or under died) was one of the UN’s Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), a set of eight development targets for 2015 approved at a UN summit in 2000. Working out the extent to which the MDGs were responsible for this decline has become a big part of the debate over whether they were a success or not. The main difficulty is to guess what would have happened had the MDGs not been set; during the 1990s, the number of child deaths was already falling steeply. King Penguins Tall in stature and long of beak, king penguins bear striking color patches along their necks, ear regions, and the sides of their beaks. In the visible light spectrum, these beak patches appear orange. Penguins are able to see into the ultraviolet region of the electromagnetic spectrum, however, and can detect additional patches of ultraviolet color along the lower bill that are imperceptible to human eyes. Scientists hypothesize that these beak markings signal sexual maturity and make penguins more attractive to mates. As a king penguin matures, the ultraviolet hue of the beak markings increases. In wild penguin studies, scientists have documented higher ultraviolet reflectance in recently formed male-female pairs. "], [" Very little is known about why crying is a uniquely human activity.", " Tears of joy have a different emotional origin than tears of sadness.", " The characteristics of crying shift in predictable ways throughout life.", " Whether or not people cry is often determined by cultural expectations. Crying Crying encompasses two very different processes: vocal wailing and tearing. Human babies excel at the former, and for good reason – bawling is a very effective way of getting attention from caregivers. Around adolescence, we begin to cry less over physical pain and more over emotional pain. Many people also start to exhibit “moral crying”, in reaction to acts of bravery, self-sacrifice and altruism. Why we do this is still a mystery. Also mysterious is why, as we age, we increasingly shed tears over things that are positive. One theory is that tears of joy do not actually reflect happiness at all; events such as weddings and holidays are often bittersweet because they remind us of the passage of time and mortality. This may be why children usually do not cry out of happiness: they don’t yet make the associations with sacrifice, loss and impermanence."]], "questions": ["33.

One took its weekly collection by passing around a\ncloth bag, while at the other the congregation placed their\nofferings on a tray. I saw no reason for the variation, but\nan older churchgoer explained that it made a big difference to what people gave. People would put coins into a\nbag because others could only hear and not see that they\nhad donated, whereas they would be more inclined to put\nnotes onto a tray as a public display of their generosity.\nFor an innocent young boy, it was a startling introduction\nto our endemic cynicism about charitable giving. You are\nseen as comically naïve if you believe that people give up\ntheir time or money purely out of the goodness of their\nown hearts. ‘What’s in it for them?’ is often the automatic\nresponse to signs of conspicuous altruism.\nIndeed, this reaction is no longer seen as cynical at all,\nbut simply realistic. Good causes are increasingly trying to convince us that there’s at least as much in charity\nfor us as there is for those we’re supposed to be helping.\nEven apparently heroically selfless lives can be reinterpreted as selfish quests for meaning, purpose or prestige. For instance, why are those who devote themselves\nto raising funds to help fight a disease so often people\nwho have lost members of their own family to it? What\nare they fighting most, the disease or their own demons?\nIn a world where pure goodness looks like fairytale\nnonsense, ‘do-gooders’ are brought crashing from their\npedestals. Mother Teresa, once a byword for selflessness,\nhas been described by Christopher Hitchens as a ‘friend\nof poverty rather than a friend of the poor’, who enjoyed\nher fame but did little to actually improve the lives of the\npoor of Calcutta.\nAre we right to be so suspicious of apparent acts of\nkindness? Cynicism about charity becomes inevitable\nonce you demand that genuine altruism is never tainted by self-interest. But why should we ever think that\nin the first place? Consider two people who give the\nsame amount to charity: one who gets pleasure from\nhelping others, and one who begrudgingly gives out of\nduty. Which is the more morally praiseworthy? If charity shouldn’t benefit the benefactor, then we are forced\nto accept that the reluctant donor is superior. But surely\nit is the mark of the truly kind that doing good feels good\nand is something they want to do.\nThere’s a kind of puritanism in the idea that charity must\nhurt to really count. The whole point of helping others\nis to make life better. But your life matters, too, so how\ncan making it worse be better? From an objective point\nof view, altruism that helps both the giver and the recipient does more good than altruism that leaves the altruist worse off.\nNor should we worry too much about motivation. People’s motives are invariably mixed, and if self-interest is\namong them, we shouldn’t worry, just as long as what\nthey do genuinely helps others, too.\nIndeed, evolutionary psychologists would argue that\nthe origins of the charitable impulse lie in the morally\nblind workings of natural selection. Put simply, groups of\norganisms that never co-operate or help each other are\nless successful at reproducing than those who do. The\nmost successful replicators are those who help each other\nout, unless their apparent kindness is abused.\nSo there is no contradiction or hypocrisy in giving that\nbenefits the benefactor. Problems only arise if apparent\naltruism helps only the giver and perhaps even harms the\nrecipient. And if you do good primarily to make yourself\nfeel better, you can lose sight of whether ‘doing good’ really helps others at all.\nThis is the danger with the generally welcome growth\nof ethical consumerism. Concern for the environment\ncan easily become a form of eco-narcissism, where the\nmain priority is to keep ourselves pure. But how altruistic is it to eat locally grown organic produce while refusing to spend money on food from countries that need\nour trade? How entitled are you to feel good about fitting a few low-energy light bulbs if you fly even once a\nyear? And might your refusal to eat gene-modified foods\nbe hampering a technology that could make feeding the\nworld’s poor easier?\nThe purpose of charity is to make life easier for everyone. Sacrificing some of your own self-interests for a substantial benefit to others is certainly laudable, and something too few of us are willing to do. But if we can help\nothers while also benefiting ourselves, that is even better. When charity really can be a win-win deal, we would\nbe foolish not to take it.\nJulian Baggini, Psychologies Magazine", "id": ""}
