The ancient Greeks knew that secretions from a\nfemale dog in heat were attractive to male dogs. In his\nbeekeepers’ manual The Feminine Monarchie, published in\n1623, Charles Butler warned that an injured bee’s “ranke\nsmell” would attract other angry bees to sting. In the late\n19th century, New York’s first state entomologist, Joseph\nLintner, noted the crowds gathered on the sidewalk outside, looking at the spectacle of 50 wild silk moth males\nattracted to a virgin female moth in his office window.\nLintner correctly observed that the attraction was probably a chemical, detected by the large, elaborate antennae\nof the males. He predicted that such an irresistible and farreaching force could be used to control agricultural pest\nmoths, if only chemists could identify and synthesize these\npowerful molecules, now known as pheromones.\nLintner’s prediction has been generously fulfilled. But\nbecause the quantity of pheromone produced by each\nanimal is so small, it was almost 70 years before the first\npheromone could be chemically identified, in 1959, by the\nNobel Prize-winning German chemist Adolf Butenandt\nand his large team.\nIn the half century since then, as the technology for\nisolating and identifying trace amounts of compounds\nhas become more refined, pheromones have been found\nin almost every kind of animal, in squid, lobsters, ants,\nfish, salamanders, and mice, to name just a few. Although\npheromones are important in many species for finding mates for sex, they can have a wide variety of other\nfunctions, such as one produced by mother rabbits that\nprompts suckling by their pups. In many social insects,\nsuch as ants, bees, and wasps, almost every part of colony\nbehavior is mediated by pheromones, from queen signals\naffecting worker reproduction within the colony to Butler’s “ranke smell” alarm pheromone that activates colony\ndefense against enemies.\nPheromones are chemical signals that have evolved for\ncommunication between members of the same species. A\npheromone signal elicits a specific reaction in the receiver,\nfor example, a stereotyped behavior (releaser effect) or a\ndevelopmental process (primer effect). Some pheromones\ncan have both effects.\nMost pheromones are detected by the sense of smell.\nHowever, not all smells are pheromones. Mammals, including humans, also give off a cloud of molecules that represent\nour unique individual “smell” or chemical profile.\nTo definitively demonstrate that a pheromone exists,\none must design a repeatable experiment, a bioassay, that\nshows that a smell molecule (odorant) causes a particular\neffect on the receiver, for example inducing a behavior.\nIt is highly likely that humans, like other mammals,\nhave pheromones. However, despite the many sites on the\nInternet offering to sell “pheromones” to make one sexually\nirresistible, no human pheromones have been chemically\nidentified to date. Sadly, there is no evidence for the widely\npublished claims that the molecules androstadienone and\nestratetraenol are human pheromones of any kind.\nAnother misuse of the term pheromone is in so-called\npheromone parties, a trend started by an artist in Brooklyn\nin 2010. At these events, singles sniff numbered T-shirts that\nhave been worn by others at the party to see if they like the\nsmell and photograph themselves with the shirt in a numbered bag to facilitate meeting up later. Although these gettogethers might sound like fun, they are misnamed, because\nthe smells on the shirts are unique to each individual, not\nspecies-wide pheromones that trigger the same behavior\nin every person. The idea behind these parties is based on\nthe surprising observation that mice preferred to mate with\nmice that were immunologically different from themselves\nin the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a difference that can be detected by smell. When a similar experiment was tried with Swiss students sniffing T-shirts, it was\ndiscovered that women similarly found the smell of men\nimmunologically different from themselves more attractive. However, subsequent replications of the experiment\nhave not shown the effect consistently and, disappointingly,\nstudies of large-scale human genome data have been equally\ninconclusive. Clearly, the idea of choosing a potential partner by smell has popular appeal even though the evidence\nis not there yet.\nThe biggest challenge for work on human pheromones\nwill be the identification of behaviors and physiological\nresponses that will make robust bioassays. Because of our\ncultural complexity and diversity, influences on human\nbehaviors are notoriously difficult to study.\nAmerican Scientist", "id": ""}
