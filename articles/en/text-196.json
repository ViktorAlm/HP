What is the main point here?", "32. What is said about the concept of “vacuum”?"], "article": "Butterflies\nButterflies may be pretty but they seem inconsequential\nornaments when compared with majestic eagles or pragmatically functional worms or bees. Every century, butterflies have become extinct in Britain. Why should we care if\nwe lose a few more? For a start, butterflies are an excellent\nindicator species: if butterflies are suffering, then so too\nare less well monitored insects that pollinate flowers, help\nmatter decompose and protect other species by preying\non pests. Plants, birds, rodents and big, greedy mammals\n– such as human beings – depend on them. Butterflies’\ndecline probably indicates a rapid decline in invertebrates\nin general.\nVacuum\nA ball spinning in a vacuum should never slow down,\nsince no outside forces are acting on it. At least that is what\nIsaac Newton would have said. But what if the vacuum\nitself creates a type of friction that puts the brakes on spinning objects? The effect, which might soon be detectable,\ncould act on interstellar dust grains. In quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle says we can never be sure\nthat an apparent vacuum is truly empty. Instead, space\nis fizzing with photons that are constantly popping into\nand out of existence before they can be measured directly.", "id": ""}
