What are we told in this text?"], "article": "Meanings\nConsider the following statements: “War continues.” “No\nsign of peace.” Does our brain treat these two sentences\ndifferently, despite their identical meaning? A new study\nsuggests it does. British researchers showed that we are\nbetter at detecting words that carry negative meaning than\nthose that are positive. Volunteers were exposed to a word\nfor a fraction of a second – too short a time to consciously\nread the word – and then asked to guess whether the word\nwas neutral or had emotional content (either positive or\nnegative). The subjects were most accurate at detecting\nthe negative words. The mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not clear, but researchers speculate that the\nbrain might process negative stimuli faster than positive\nones. A different explanation could be that information\nprocessing is equally fast for both types of information but\nthat negative words better capture our attention, causing\nthe processing to start earlier.", "id": ""}
