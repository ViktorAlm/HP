Medications which block the\naction of the chemical messenger dopamine have been\nfound in studies to be effective in reducing the frequency\nand intensity of tics. Preliminary evidence suggests that\nsome behavioural therapies, especially habit reversal, can\nbe helpful for Tourette’s disorder; it is not known whether\ncombining these techniques with medication yields an\nadditive benefit. Habit reversal teaches patients to become\naware of the premonitory urges preceding tics and to learn\nand practice muscular actions incompatible with their tics.\nSopranos\nThe much-parodied large Wagnerian soprano, resplendent\nin a horned helmet, may soon be a fond operatic memory.\nPundits are hailing the birth of a new breed of female\nopera singers – all of them sylphs. At the world-renowned\nSalzburg festival, the heaving bosom of a traditional, generously proportioned opera diva has been replaced by slim\nwaists and scanty outfits. The streets and shop windows\nof the Austrian city are papered with posters celebrating\nsvelte figures of international stars that have flown in to\nsing. And three of them together would fit inside the voluminous costumes once worn on stage by great singers such\nas Joan Sutherland and Montserrat Caballé.", "id": ""}
