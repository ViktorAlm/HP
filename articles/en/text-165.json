Despite the fact that many of\nthem are now urbanised, the essence of their misty land\nand its spiritual world is deep within their psyche and\nstill relevant.\nIn fact, the belief is that each rock on the Inyanga\nslopes, wonderfully varied in colour, contains a spirit\nunique to that stone. As an exhibition review in a London newspaper put it recently: “Shona sculpture is an\nart movement which emerged in Zimbabwe in the 1960s\nand has now been hailed on the international art scene.\nIt is sculpture of world quality, extracting the individual\nspirit of the stone.”\nPotent traditions of spiritual connection and myth may\nwell link contemporary Zimbabwean sculpture to steatite\ncarvings, particularly of birds, created at Great Zimbabwe, the imposing city structure built of stone circa 1500\nAD, and surrounded by massive walls. From long past,\nthe Shona have been a gentle, deeply reflective people,\nmystically inclined and armed with enduring patience and\nresourcefulness. Even in warfare, they relied on traditional\nreligious systems for power, defeating Portuguese invaders in 1600.\nThe key to Shona life is the family – women, men and\ntheir children, as well as their ancestors. In the past a\nmember of the family was a muvesi or carver, empowered\nby a Mudzimu, a special ancestral spirit who manifested\nin dreams.\nThe muvesi created household items with great artistry\nin wood and clay, though not usually stone, as a way of\nrecounting what he had seen in a dream. This heritage is\nembedded in the work of modern Shona sculptors, though\ntheirs is clearly not for functional purposes.\nThe present art movement surged into public consciousness in the early 1960s with the encouragement of\nFrank McEwen, the first director of the National Gallery\nin Harare. He quickly realised the inherent sculptural brilliance of the Shona, enabling sculptors to form a workshop at the gallery, helping to sell their work there, and\nfairly soon to exhibit it abroad. Many exhibitions at global\nvenues have followed, as far afield as Japan.\nIn 1966, a second European, Tom Blomefield, made\navailable land on which he had been farming, which had\na vast deposit of serpentine stone. This enabled a group\nof sculptural stars to shine. Initially, Blomefield encouraged them by supplying them with tools, shelter and food.\nAll the sculpture produced was transported 100 miles to\nHarare where it was successfully sold, enabling the artists to become independent. Now, a second generation of\nurban artists has gained recognition, based in Harare or\nestablishing themselves in Europe.\nMost Shona artists have no formal art training, but were\ntaught by relatives or a master sculptor. Brothers Gedion\nand Collen were instructed by their father, Claud Nyanhongo. Gedion says: “I started making sculptures before I\nknew my name.” He has now achieved international success, with studios in Zimbabwe and the USA. His work\nexplores social issues such as unemployment, as well as\nhuman love and the spiritual power it can provide. “I want\nto make people happy and to promote peace,” he adds.\nJuliet Highet, New African", "id": ""}
