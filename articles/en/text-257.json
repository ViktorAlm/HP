Philosophers and biologists have asked the\nquestion for centuries, noting that humans are universally\ndrawn to music.\nSome scientists conclude that music’s influence may\nbe a chance event, arising from its ability to hijack brain\nsystems built for other purposes such as language, emotions and movement. As Harvard University psychologist Steven Pinker famously puts it, music is “auditory\ncheesecake”, a confection crafted to tickle the areas of the\nmind that evolved for more important functions. But as\na result of chance, music seems to offer a novel system\nof communication rooted in emotions rather than meaning. Recent data show, for example, that music reliably\nconveys certain sentiments: what we feel when we hear a\npiece of music is remarkably similar to what everybody in\nthe room is experiencing. Emerging evidence also indicates that music brings out predictable responses across\ncultures and among people of widely varying musical and\ncognitive abilities.\nThroughout recorded history, people have attempted\nto explain music’s sway over the human spirit. Music has\nbeen labelled everything from a gift of the heavens to a\ntool of the Devil, from an extension of mathematics to\na side effect of language processing. Indeed, music has\nbeen found to excite brain regions involved in understanding and producing language, including Broca’s area\nand Wernicke’s area, both located on the left hemisphere\non the surface of the brain. Thus, musical syntax – for\ninstance, the order of chords in a phrase – could have\nrisen from the mechanisms that evolved to organize and\nunderstand grammar. But tunes also recruit other brain\nsystems, principally perhaps those governing emotions\nsuch as fear, joy and sorrow.\nMusic’s simultaneous activation of diverse brain circuits\nseems to produce some remarkable effects. Several pieces of research indicate that music reliably conveys the\nintended emotions in all people who hear it. The musical\ntongue may also transcend more fundamental communication barriers. In studies conducted over the past decades,\na cognitive research team played music for both autistic\nand non-autistic children, comparing those with similar\nlanguage skills, and asked the kids to match the music to\nemotions. They found that kids’ ability to recognize different feelings in music did not depend on their diagnosis. Autistic and typical children with similar verbal skills\nperformed equally well, indicating that music can reliably\nconvey feelings even in people whose ability to pick up\nemotion-laden social cues, such as facial expressions or\ntone of voice, is severely compromised.\nMusic’s ability to convey feelings may underlie one of its\nmost important benefits. In most cultures, music is always\na communal event: everyone gets together to sing, dance\nand play instruments. Even in Western societies, which\nuniquely differentiate musical performers from listeners,\npeople enjoy music together in a wide variety of settings:\ndancing at a wedding or a night club, singing hymns in\nchurch, crooning with their kids, Christmas carolling and\nsinging “Happy Birthday” at a party. The popularity of\nsuch rituals suggests that music confers social cohesiveness, perhaps by creating empathetic connections among\nmembers of a group.\nMusic also bestows advantages on us as individuals.\nUnderlying our conscious impressions of a tune are psychological effects that can improve our mental and physical well-being. Studies show that upbeat, tense or exciting music can physically excite the listener, triggering the\nbody’s fight and flight response: heart and breathing rates\nincrease, a person may break out in a sweat, and adrenaline enters the blood-stream. This “pumping up” effect\nexplains why so many people enjoy listening to rock while\nthey work out – the music primes the psychological systems needed for high-energy movement. Energizing melodies tend to boost our mood in general, waking us up if\nwe are feeling tired and creating a sense of excitement in\nany situation. On the other hand, music can be calming,\nreducing the levels of the stress hormone cortisol in the\nblood, lowering heart and respiration rates, and alleviating\npain, according to several studies.\nKaren Schrock, Scientific American Mind", "id": ""}
