Cooking The film Julie & Julia will, I hope, knock cookery off the pedestal it has acquired of being a pastime, a hobby or primarily an enjoyable activity. Cooking is, in fact, characterised by duty, boredom, bossiness and chaos; it is life in microcosm. Julie Powell, who set herself the task of cooking all 524 recipes in Julia Child’s Mastering the Art of French Cooking, had the right idea about food preparation: set yourself up for tightly scheduled failures on a regimented basis. This ensures that any passing pleasure one might find in the sensuality of cooking or the refinement of one’s talents will be overwhelmed by tedium and obligation. As it should be. A Health Issue Studies have shown that reducing typical calorie consumption, usually by 30 to 40 percent, extends life span by a third or more in many animals, including nematodes, fruit flies and rodents. When it comes to calorie restriction in primates and people, however, the jury is still out. Although some studies have suggested that monkeys that eat less live longer, a new 25-year-long primate study concluded that calorie restriction does not extend average life span in rhesus monkeys. Even if calorie restriction does not help anyone live longer, a large portion of the data supports the idea that limiting food intake reduces the risks of diseases common in old age and lengthens the period of life spent in good health."], ["The benefits of education should be spread more equally among the members of a democratic society.", "From a global perspective, democratic ideals are no longer seen as self-evident in education.", "In education, steps should be taken to make young people realize the importance of democratic ideas.", "The spread of democracy has tended to devalue the quality of education in many parts of the world. Democracy and Education During the era in which people began to demand democratic self-governance, education all over the world was remodelled to produce the sort of student who could function well in this demanding form of government: not a cultivated gentleman, stuffed with the wisdom of the ages, but an active, critical, reflective, and empathetic member of a community of equals, capable of exchanging ideas on a basis of respect and understanding with people from many different backgrounds. Today we still maintain that we like democracy and self-governance, and we also think that we like freedom of speech, respect for difference, and understanding of others. We give these values lip service, but we think far too little about what we need to do in order to transmit them to the next generation and ensure their survival."]], "questions": ["33.

Several large-scale\npopulation studies have reinforced a single premise: the\nmore you engage with religious activities, the better off\nyou are.\nYet many people are less certain about their beliefs than\never before. Non-believers number between 500 million\nand 750 million worldwide, according to one analysis. In\nthe past two decades, the percentage of the U.S. population that proclaims its religious affiliation as “none” has\nmore than doubled, to about 15 percent. Many of these\nindividuals do not identify as atheists; even so, many of\nthem conduct their life outside the religious establishment. Although research on this population is only now\nemerging, a recent study found that people who were less\ncommitted to their religious creed were actually less happy\nthan avowed atheists.\nIf the shifting beliefs of a growing number of people\nportend lower health and a less contented outlook, knowing exactly how religion benefits its followers becomes\na matter of public concern. Several recent studies have\nsought to answer this question by examining it with\ngreater resolution. For the first time, researchers have collected a representative sample of the world that measures\nreligiosity and happiness. They found that the positive\neffects of religion depend enormously on where you live.\nReligious people may be happier than their godless counterparts, but only if the society they belong to values religion highly, which not all societies do. For atheists and the\ngrowing ranks of unaffiliated individuals, these findings\nbode well. Although many questions remain about how\nnonbelievers can acquire the health benefits of religion,\nscientists are now finding that secular communities of\nlike-minded people can offer similar social support.\nTo examine how the U.S., where being religious is the\ncultural norm, compares with the rest of the world, psychologist Ed Diener of the University of Illinois and his\ncolleagues conducted a global survey, including a state-bystate sample in the U.S. In line with earlier findings, two\nthirds of those surveyed regarded religion as important to\ntheir life. The states, however, varied by a factor of two:\nin Vermont, 44 percent rated religion as important, compared with 88 percent in Mississippi. In the states where\nreligion was very important, people were much more likely\nto be living in difficult circumstances. They also had lower\nsubjective well-being than people living in less religious\nparts of the country. Did religion make them happier, as\nprevious studies had shown? Absolutely, according to the\ndata – but they were worse off than the contented residents of more affluent states, where religion mattered less.\nGlobally, people in 154 countries were surveyed, with\nan average of 3,000 people per country. Overall, three out\nof four reported that religion was important in their life.\nAgain, the devil was in the details. The countries in\nthe sample varied in religiosity by a factor of six, ranging\nfrom 16 percent of respondents in Sweden agreeing that\nreligion was an important part of their life to 99 percent\naffirmation in Bangladesh, Egypt, Sri Lanka and Somaliland. In this global poll, a tough environment also tended\nto coincide with greater national religiosity. If you live in\na nation where daily existence is difficult, your life satisfaction is generally lower. In those countries, being more\nreligious appears to grant you a premium on happiness\nthat your less religious neighbours do not enjoy. If the\nliving is easy, however, both nonbelievers and religious\npeople have similar, relatively high subjective well-being.\nThis effect held true for all religions represented in the\nsample – Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and Islam.\nMore important, whether a person was struggling or\nthriving was nowhere near as predictive of religiosity as a\nsociety’s conditions and norms. “Do you have individual\nchoice about what you believe? Yes, but there are strong\ninfluences in society – whether everyone around you is\nreligious,” Ed Diener says. “That’s the eye-opener for me,\nthat societal forces led to religiosity rather than individual\nforces.”\nFor nonbelievers, these are heartening data. They bolster the idea that believers will accrue more psychological\nbenefits only in places that value religion more, and vice\nversa. It means atheists are not permanently shut off from\nsome fountain of happiness – although they may want to\nfind a like-minded community to live in.\nSandra Upson, Scientific American Mind", "id": ""}
