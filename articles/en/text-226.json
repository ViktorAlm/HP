Foremost\namong these voyagers are the Pacific islanders themselves,\nnot just those who migrated eastwards several thousand\nyears ago in voyages unique for their range and rapidity,\nbut those who from the late 18th century travelled across\nand beyond the ocean, and those who had always moved\nbetween its various archipelagos. European voyagers, traders, missionaries, and colonisers are given their due but have\nno special precedence in Thomas’s account.\nPacific history has come a long way since Alan Moorehead published The Fatal Impact (1966), in which the\nPacific is seen as a paradisal space fatally wounded by the\nincursion of Europeans. According to this view, islanders\nwere the passive victims of an inevitable fate. Historically\ninclined anthropologists such as Greg Dening and Thomas himself then provided an alternative model by emphasising the interactive nature of cross-cultural contacts\nbetween Europeans and islanders. The beach became the\nmargin where cultural difference was negotiated and from\nwhich neither side would come away unchanged.\nAnother reconceptualisation was made by the Tongan\nintellectual Epeli Hau’ofa in an influential essay, Our Sea\nof Islands. Islanders, he argued, were connected rather than\nseparated by the sea. Far from being sea-locked peoples\nmarooned on coral or volcanic tips of land, islanders formed an oceanic community based on voyaging.\nRecent historians have emphasised islanders as actors\nrather than victims but have still tended to assume that\nisland communities were bounded. Hau’ofa’s essay is concerned with inter-island passages rather than with voyaging beyond the Pacific. In contrast, Thomas argues that\nislanders were outward looking and curious. Not only was\nthe Pacific a place rather than a space, it was a cosmopolitan world in which islanders, Europeans, east Asians, black\nAmericans and others met and mixed, entered and left.\nThese voyages were social and conceptual as well as\ngeographic. Travellers to and from the Pacific experienced\nnew worlds that changed how they thought and felt, and\ncarried home stories which influenced the communities,\nisland or continent from which they derived. Thomas\npresents the history of the Pacific as a compound of the\nmany stories told by voyagers, including those islanders\nwho made their way to Canton, San Francisco or London,\nor who found themselves on the beaches of other Pacific\nislands far from their home.\nThere are famous examples of such travellers, notably\nMai (Omai), who Captain James Cook brought to London from Tahiti on his second voyage. Thomas is more\ninterested in less-known figures such as another Tahitian,\nTapioi, who arrived in London via Tonga, Sydney and\nmany Asian and Atlantic ports and figured as the plaintiff\nin a trial at Clerkenwell magistrates’ court in 1808.\nIf Thomas’s new account of Pacific history seems the\nmost inclusive and nuanced we have, popular conceptions\nof the region remain stuck at the level of ‘paradise found\nand lost’. On the rare occasions when news from Oceania\nis reported in Britain – a coup or a tsunami – the headline\nis invariably “Trouble in Paradise”.\nIslanders is not only a fine work of scholarship but also\na lucid and engrossing read. It would be nice to think that\nit makes its own fatal impact on the outmoded public\nunderstanding of the world’s most extensive community.\nRod Edmund, BBC History Magazine", "id": ""}
