What are we told?"], "article": "Therapy\nIn a new book, two academics say the craze for giving\npupils therapy through education is leaving a generation\nself-obsessed, introverted and unable to take criticism.\nPupils are left ‘infantilised’, ‘hapless’ and ‘unwilling to\naccept challenges to their ideas’, according to Dr Dennis Hayes and Professor Kathryn Ecclestone of Oxford\nBrookes University.
