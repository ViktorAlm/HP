It begins, “To understand a\ncountry well and the character of its inhabitants, some\nhistory is needed.” Th ough a seemingly anodyne document, it represents a signifi cant moment in our offi cial\napproach to history.\nFor the fi rst time, certain parts of our story are\nbeing highlighted as representative of national identity.\nDespite claims that the document is there to help people\nunderstand conversational references to “Dunkirk spirit”,\nhistory in the hands of the Home Offi ce has become a\npowerful tool. Th e past is being mobilised to assist the\ngovernment’s campaign for greater integration. Th e multiculturalism of the 1980s and 90s, with its emphasis on\nthe validity of indigenous and adopted cultures, is being\nabandoned in favour of a codifi cation of Britishness.\nCharged with such an onerous responsibility, how does\nCrick do? Well, quite rightly, he prefaces his narrative with\na warning about the subjective nature of his approach.\n“Any account of British history is ... an interpretation.\nNo one person would agree with another what to put in,\nwhat to leave out, and how to say it.” With that out of the\nway, Crick then launches into a Whiggish chronicle of the\n“making” of modern Britain.\nAnd, as predicted, there is something here to infuriate\nand please all audiences. At times, the narrative appears\nsuperfi cial; at other times overcomplicated. Radicals will\nquibble with Crick’s characterization of Oliver Cromwell\nas a “God-fearing dictator” and certainly dispute his rosy\nview of empire. Traditionalists might raise an eyebrow at\nthe single paragraph devoted to the Industrial Revolution.\nTh ey might also fi nd undercurrents of bias in his treatment of the Th atcher and Blair administrations.\nTo my mind, there is not enough intellectual history or\na proper account of the role of religion. Th ere are plenty\nof Kings and Queens, but no Th omas Hobbes or Charles\nDarwin. Cultural historians will be disappointed by notable absences in their fi eld.\nBut given every critic will have an axe to grind, Crick has\ndone a magnifi cent job of presenting Britain’s complex,\nmultifarious past in a comprehensible and intelligent way.\nHe appropriately positions the UK within both a European and global perspective. Above all, this history reads\nwell. Th ankfully, it does not seem to have been hacked\ntogether by committee. Instead, it enjoys an authorial tone\nwhich carries the reader along.\nNonetheless, behind Th e Making of the United Kingdom lurks an offi cial agenda. Underpinning the narrative\nis an argument about Britain being a nation of migrants\nwho, over the past centuries, have successfully come\ntogether by carefully combining their indigenous traditions with a new British identity. “We have been, after\nall, a multinational and multicultural society for a long\ntime now without losing either our over arching British\nidentity or our Scottish, Welsh, Irish or English cultural\nand national identities.”\nTh us, new citizens are reassured that they comprise\nbut the latest chapter of our national story. Immigration\nand integration are as redolent of British history as John\nBull, the Battle of Trafalgar and the Blitz spirit. But, Crick\nrightly reminds them, “It all works reasonably well so long\nas no identities are asserted as exclusive of others.”\nOne of the best-selling history books of the last few\nyears was George Courtauld’s traditionalist polemic, Th e\nPocket Book of Patriotism. Upset by the state of history\nteaching in schools, Courtauld successfully packaged\ntogether an arbitrary collection of dates and details to\nremind his readership of the building blocks of the British\npast. Crick’s pamphlet is an altogether more sophisticated\nanswer to such worries in an age of ever greater migrant\nfl ows. And, truth be told, if new citizens were to absorb his\nrich and subtle account of British history, they would be\nin a stronger position than many “native” undergraduates.\nTristram Hunt, BBC History", "id": ""}
