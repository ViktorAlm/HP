But\nwhen you consider how dependent the beauty business\nis on the effi cacy of the ingredients that go into its products – and how much more fruitful and active plants that\nhave been grown biodynamically have proved to be – it is\nperhaps more surprising that it has taken so long for the\nbeauty industry to tap into the concept.\nCorrespondence Database\nIn his own word, it was a “presumptuous” idea that –\nmore than any other – opened up a long-standing rift between the sciences and religion.
