Founded and directed by Berry\nGordy, a Detroit-born child of middle-class parents who\nmigrated from violently segregationist Georgia in the\n1920’s, Motown brought together the talents of an amazing, largely Detroit-based, group of songwriters, singers,\nproducers and musicians, who succeeded in creating hit\nafter hit for nearly 30 years.\nFrom Jackie Wilson and Smokey Robinson in the early\n1960’s through the Supremes and the Jackson Five (to say\nnothing of Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and the solo careers of Diana Ross and Michael Jackson), Motown was\na veritable music factory. Gordy strove for a sound that\nwould cross over, appealing to whites along with a core\nblack constituency. White singers had previously captured\nthis audience with their versions of black artists’ work, and\nGordy would change that by making black music more\naccessible to whites, intentionally softening gospel shouts\nand rhythm and blues tones. He sought financial success\nand public acclaim, but in the process he and the artists\nhe worked with influenced the listening habits of young\nAmericans of all racial and ethnic backgrounds.\nIt is this complex story that Gerald Posner explores\nin Motown: Music, Money, Sex, and Power. Posner is an\naccomplished author of numerous books, including wellreceived studies of the assassinations of John Kennedy and\nMartin Luther King, and is a highly regarded investigative\nreporter as well. These skills, however, are less evident in\nhis current effort. Gordy and the “major Motown stars”\nboycotted him. Other people insisted on anonymity. The\nresult is a book that depends in large part on previously\npublished newspaper stories and autobiographies, which\nlend it an air of familiarity.\nPosner, who exhibits something of a tin ear, discusses\nneither the lyrics nor the music itself, does not examine\nits origins in earlier black musical expression and never\nmentions soul music, a contemporaneous popular music\nthat was deeply grounded in gospel and also appealed to\nwhite audiences. However, the issue of crossing over from\nblack to white audiences is central to the music and the\neconomics of Motown, as Posner himself acknowledges.\nEven today, crossing over is a contentious issue, producing\na variety of interpretations. Disagreements about the meaning of crossing over reveal core beliefs about race identity and racial politics, and the lack of any analysis here\nis painfully glaring.\nMotown began its existence in the late 1950’s, at the\nvery end of the postwar expansion of independent record\ncompanies, like Chess and Sun, recording the early work\nof everyone from Elvis Presley to James Brown. The bottom line for all these companies was simple survival, and\nthe weapon was a cutthroat business ethic.\nAs a former Detroit record store owner, Gordy was\nno stranger to this environment; so it should not be surprising that from the company’s inception numerous\nMotown artists complained about royalty payments and\nother business arrangements tilted to Gordy’s advantage.\nMotown under Gordy never cheated its artists outright,\nbut it did take advantage of them time and again. Posner\nfails to fully grasp Gordy’s drive for economic success and\npublic prominence, instead describing an almost idyllic\nscene in which a version of standard family values, under\na paternalistic Gordy, reigned supreme.\nGordy was always a businessman. He built a company to create, make and then sell its product as widely\nas possible. His commitment to promoting black cultural\nexpression never interfered with his eagerness to maximize\nprofits. Still, Gordy had an ear for the music. And he had a\nsensitivity to consumer trends that helped establish a style\nthat continues to influence American popular culture.\nNick Salvatore, The New York Times Book Review", "id": ""}
