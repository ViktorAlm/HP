What is said in relation to ecology?", "39. What is the main point in this text?", "40. What can be concluded from this text?"], "article": "Ecology\nArne Naess was Norway’s best-known philosopher, whose\nconcept of deep ecology enriched and divided the environmental movement. Trough his books and lectures, Naess\ntaught that ecology should not be concerned with man’s\nplace in nature but with every part of nature on an equal\nbasis, because the natural order has a value that transcends\nhuman values. Indeed, humans could only attain “realisation of the self” as part of an entire ecosphere. Shallow\necology, he believed, meant thinking big ecological problems could be resolved within an industrial, capitalist society. Deep ecology meant understanding that society has\ncaused the Earth-threatening ecological crisis. His concept\nentered the mainstream green movement in the 1980s.\nGroups\nJust because a group is full of intelligent individuals does\nnot mean the group as a whole will necessarily be smart.\nBut having more women does, according to a new study.\nTe researchers found that a group’s collective intelligence\nis afected not by individual intelligence but by social sensitivity and the ability to make inferences – skills women\nare more likely to possess than men.\nIatrogenic Deaths\nWhat is the third leading cause of death in the developed\nworld? Te answer is “iatrogenic” deaths – those caused by\nmedical errors, adverse drug reactions or hospital-acquired\ninfections. For all modern medicine’s ability to alleviate\nsufering and prevent premature deaths, it also causes\nplenty of both. Many medical interventions turn out to\nhave unintended and negative consequences that often\nemerge as a result of research into better treatments. None\nof this suggests that treatments such as chemotherapy,\npainkillers or antibiotics do more harm than good overall.\nAnd the research that reveals their efects will help us to\ndevelop still more efective treatments. But it does highlight the need to think broadly about iatrogenic deaths.", "id": ""}
