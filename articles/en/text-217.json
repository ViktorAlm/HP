Her celebrity would, as the director\nof the Paris Observatory noted, “shine down through the\nages”.\nDr Maskelyne hoped Caroline Herschel did not feel\nisolated among the male community of astronomers in\nBritain and “for the benefit of terrestrial astronomy, will\nnot think of taking a flight”, at least not until her achievements were recognised by his colleagues in the Royal\nSociety. Curiously, no such recognition was forthcoming.\nAlthough it was founded in 1660, women were not permitted by statute to become fellows of the Royal Society\nuntil 285 years later, in 1945. The re-examination of the\nRoyal Society archives during its 350th birthday has\nthrown new and unexpected light on the lost women of\nscience. It emerges that women had a far more fruitful, if\nsometimes conflicted, relationship with the Royal Society\nthan has previously been supposed.\nIndeed, the Royal Society archives suggest something\nso fundamental that it may require a subtle revision of\nthe standard history of science in Britain. This is the previously unsuspected degree to which women were a catalyst in the early discussion of the social role of science.\nMore even than their male colleagues, they had a gift\nfor imagining the human impact of scientific discovery.\nPrecisely by being excluded from the fellowship of the\nsociety, they saw the life of science in a wider world. They\nraised questions about its duties and its moral responsibilities, its promise and its menace, in ways we can appreciate far more fully today.\nThe first woman to attend a meeting of the Royal Society\nwas Margaret Cavendish, the Duchess of Newcastle, in\nMay 1667. There were protests from the all-male fellows –\nthe scandal was reported – and the dangerous experiment\nwas not repeated for another couple of centuries.\nMargaret Cavendish later raised issues that have become\nperennial. She mocked the dry, empirical approach of the\nfellows, violently attacked the practice of vivisection and\nwondered what rational explanation could be given for\nwomen’s exclusion from learned bodies. She questioned\nthe Baconian notion of relentless mechanical progress\nin her polemic Observations on Experimental Philosophy\n(1668). She also produced arguably the first-ever sciencefiction story, The Blazing World (1666), which considered\nthe alternative futures of science. All this earned her the\nsobriquet “Mad Madge”.\nThe first original paper that might be considered as part\nof a scientific research programme conducted by a woman\nand published in the Royal Society’s journal, Philosophical Transactions, concerned extra-terrestrial phenomena.\nIt was by Caroline Herschel (sister to William Herschel,\nthe great Romantic astronomer) in August 1786. Caroline\nHerschel’s speciality was discovering comets, of which she\nfound eight at a time when fewer than 30 were known.\nHer brother was immensely proud of her, built her special\ntelescopes and helped her to obtain the first state salary\nfor a female astronomer in Britain. Caroline Herschel also\nkept an observational journal for more than 30 years. It\nis one of the earliest records of how science actually gets\ndone, its secret tribulations as well as its public triumphs.\nBy the turn of the century, major science was indeed\ndone by women. Heartha Ayrton was producing highly\noriginal work on the electric arc. Although rejected as a\nfellow in 1902, she was the first woman to read her own\npaper at a Royal Society meeting two years later and was\nawarded the Royal Society’s Hughes medal in 1906. Slowly\nthe tide was turning.\nThese remarkable women had already added a third\ndimension to the whole scientific enterprise as originally\nconceived by Lord Bacon, and by the founding fathers of\nthe Royal Society. The two primary aims of science had\nlong been established as the discovery of the nature of\nphysical reality “by experiment and proof”, and the applications of such discoveries “for the relief of man’s estate”.\nThe third, fundamental imperative is that science should\ndisperse the seeds of knowledge to all and as imaginatively\nas possible. Until science knowledge was explained, explored and widely understood, the work of scientists would\nalways be incomplete.\nRichard Holmes, The Guardian Weekly", "id": ""}
