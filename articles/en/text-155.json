While the rebuilding efforts continue apace, everyone seems to agree that the city that eventually emerges\nfrom the wreckage will be very different to the “old” New\nOrleans. But it was not just the physical city that was\ndevastated by Katrina. Equally damaged was its carefully\ncultivated image as the city that care forgot. Shocked by\nthe indelible images of destruction wrought by the hurricane and its aftermath, the world was presented with an\nunsettling and unfamiliar vision of a city that it thought\nit knew well.\nFor many years, New Orleans had traded on a painstakingly constructed sense of itself as a tourist town. Before\nKatrina, the city was famous the world over as one of\nAmerica’s most beloved playgrounds, known for its food,\nits music, for Mardi Gras and the hedonism of Bourbon\nStreet and for letting the good times roll. It was also a city\nthat capitalised on its history – or, at least, selected highlights from its past.\nWhatever else it did, Hurricane Katrina tore away the\ncity’s elaborate carnival mask and demonstrated that life in\nthe Big Easy has not always been so. In stark contrast to its\nlaissez-faire reputation, this 21st-century disaster evoked\nparts of the city’s hidden history, exposing a landscape\nthat had long been scarred by repeated traumas. Indeed,\nthough Katrina may have seemed a uniquely terrible event\nto modern eyes, it was a relatively characteristic moment\nin the history of a city used to extraordinary reversals of\nfortune. It was a reminder that catastrophe, adversity and\nrebirth had been part of the fabric of life in New Orleans\nsince its foundation in 1718. Flood, fire, famine and war –\nNew Orleans has seen it all.\nBeginning life as a small colonial backwater on the\nbanks of the Mississippi River, traded between France and\nSpain and valued largely for its strategic location, New\nOrleans was acquired by the United States in 1803 as part\nof the Louisiana Purchase. It soon became one of the richest and most powerful cities in the US, made prosperous\nby the cotton trade and its status as the home of the largest slave market in the South. By the mid-19th century,\nNew Orleans was internationally famous as the imperious,\nopulent, cosmopolitan Queen of the South.\nThat success, however, came at significant cost, since\nthe city’s rise took place against a backdrop of repeated disasters and an almost constant sense of flux. Partly this was\na result of its location. Or, as New Orleans Mayor Marc\nMorial put it in 2001: ‘This was a lousy place to put a city.’\nUnsurprisingly, therefore, the city’s particular relationship\nwith catastrophe has long been proverbial.\nAs bad as hurricanes and conflagrations and potential\nslave rebellions could be, perhaps no single threat was\nmore pressing and more characteristic of 19th-century\nNew Orleans than disease. In the years before the Civil\nWar, New Orleans had the highest mortality rate in the\nUnited States. Cholera carried away nearly 5,000 people\nin 1832 alone. More terrifying still were the periodic visitations of yellow fever. The city suffered multiple outbreaks\nof the disease from the late 18th to the early 20th century,\nbut it was in the middle of the 19th century that the worst\nincidents took place.\nIn countless ways, the previous traumas in the life of\nNew Orleans prefigured the ways in which the evils of\nKatrina and its aftermath unfolded. Indeed, what the\nevents of 2005 also revealed was the degree to which, even\nbefore Katrina, this was a city marked by disaster. While\n21st-century New Orleans may not have been bothered by\nrepeated yellow fever epidemics, it was certainly plagued\nby the highest per-capita murder rate in America – an\naccolade, unfortunately, that the city currently looks set\non reclaiming.\nYet, if this modern moment of devastation evokes\npast disasters, it also brings to mind previous moments\nof rebirth for the city. The continued existence of New\nOrleans is a story of survival against the odds and repeated\nrenewals. Of course, this new beginning is tinged with\ntragedy. That there have already been profound problems\nwith the rebuilding effort is clear for all to see. That those\nproblems have been unfairly spread is equally evident; a\nrecent study showed that the city’s neighbourhoods are\nnow more segregated than they were before Katrina.\nThe seemingly inevitable cycles of death and rebirth\nmight be woven into the fabric of New Orleans’ history\nand, as an incident like the BP oil spill highlighted, there\nis little doubt that a city in such a ‘lousy place’ is likely\nto face hard times again. But as the process of rebuilding\ncontinues, this might at least be the moment to lay some\nghosts to rest.\nThomas Ruys Smith, History Today", "id": ""}
