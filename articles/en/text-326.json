Reading through the\npaper, Epstein says, “I felt as though a small stick of\ndynamite had gone off my head.” Epstein had unearthed\na rare copy of a detailed study on the sexual behaviour\nof Ugandans in the late 1980s and early 90s, a period\nthat coincided with the country’s historic drop in HIV\nrates. In short, Epstein knew, the research done by Maxine Ankrah, an African-American academic, would give\ninvaluable insights into what had halted the epidemic\n– insights that then could be applied to other countries\nwith high rates of HIV and AIDS.\nBefore Epstein’s discovery, Ankrah’s research seemed\ndestined for oblivion. A United Nations AIDS researcher\nhad read it, failed to understand its signifi cance or to\ncredit it and, Epstein recounts, wrongly concluded that\nan increase in condom use was responsible for the decrease\nof the HIV rate in Uganda. In reality, according to three\nlater analyses of Ankrah’s study, the primary reason for\nthe decline was completely diff erent: substantial numbers\nof Ugandans had ended aff airs and remained faithful to\none partner.\nUganda has long been a focal point in the contentious\nworld of AIDS policy. But sometimes a bolt of clarity\nshoots out of the blue, as it did for Epstein when she read\nAnkrah’s paper – and it will for readers of this book who\nyearn for insights on how a deadly virus now infects an\nestimated 25 million Africans and has killed untold millions more. Reading Th e Invisible Cure is like travelling\ninto remote and hard-to-comprehend territory with an\nunblinking and sure-footed guide.\nAfter fi ve years in Washington covering politics of\nAIDS and three years in Africa writing about the lives of\nthose infected and aff ected, in truth, I have little patience\nfor books on AIDS in Africa. With few exceptions, they\ntend to be too self-important, too polemical, too grim\nand too at odds with my experiences in the fi eld. Epstein,\nin contrast, teaches me things I didn’t know. Her rigorous reporting unearths new fi ndings among old, wornout issues. And the evidence she puts forward could provide a roadmap for comprehensive prevention programs\nthat incorporate teaching abstinence, using condoms and,\nmost critically, emphasizing fi delity.\nEpstein began her work in Africa in 1993 as a scientist\nfor a biotechnology company working in Uganda on an\nAIDS vaccine. Epstein often focuses on failures, including\nher own early search for a vaccine. “In science, failures are\noften as important as successes, because they tell us where\nthe limits are”, she writes in the preface. “When it comes\nto fi ghting AIDS, our greatest mistake may have been\nto overlook the fact that, in spite of everything, African\npeople often know best how to solve their own problems.”\nLater, she expands on this theme, criticizing many outsiders who come to Africa to work on AIDS. “Everyone\nseems to know what Africa needs,” she writes.\nIn Uganda, Epstein found a powerful example of Africans taking the lead in the fi ght. When scientists fi rst\nreported the decline in Uganda’s HIV prevalence in 1995,\nEpstein says, she and others assumed it was because so\nmany Ugandans had died from AIDS, not because they\nwere sleeping around less. What had actually taken place,\nshe writes, was a “very African” prevention approach. It\nwas led by the President’s call for “zero grazing” – meaning\ncouple should stay faithful to each other. Th is call inspired\nUgandans to talk about AIDS more openly, which in turn\nerased the stigma of the disease to some degree, empowered\nwomen to divorce unfaithful husbands and cast shame on\nthose who continued to have aff airs. Hence Epstein’s title\nand theme – “the invisible cure.”\nJohn Donnelly, New York Times Book Review", "id": ""}
