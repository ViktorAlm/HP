Generation after generation\nof your ancestors, reaching back in time through civilisations, ice ages and epic migration out of Africa, to the very\norigin of our species. And on the other side, take a chimp\nand line up its ancestors. How far back do you have to\ngo, how many generations have to pass, before the two\nlines meet?\nWe know that at some point we shared a common\nancestor, but exactly when – and what that ancestor was\nlike – have been maddeningly hard to pin down. Palaeontologists have searched for fossil remains, and geneticists\nhave rummaged through the historical documents that are\nhuman and chimp DNA. Both made discoveries but they\ndid not see eye to eye.\nThe obvious first place to look for answers is in the fossil record. But fossil humans are notoriously thin on the\nground and difficult to interpret. Geneticists have more to\nwork with. DNA contains telltale traces of events in a species’ past, including information about common ancestry\nand speciation.\nAs two species diverge from a common ancestor, their\nDNA becomes increasingly different, largely due to the\naccumulation of random mutations. The amount of\ngenetic difference between two related species is therefore\nproportional to the length of time since they diverged.\nTo estimate when the human–chimp split occurred,\ngeneticists can simply count the differences in matching\nstretches of chimp and human DNA and divide it by the\nrate at which mutations accumulate. This is known as the\nmolecular clock method.\nBut there is a catch. To arrive at the answer, you have\nto know how fast the mutations arise. And that leads you\nback to square one: you first need to know how long ago\nwe split from chimpanzees.\nTo get around this catch-22, geneticists turned to orangutans. Fossils suggest that they split from our lineage\nbetween 10 and 20 million years ago. Using this fudge,\ngeneticists arrived at a mutation rate of about 75 mutations per genome per generation. In other words, offspring\nof humans and chimps each have 75 new mutations that\nthey did not inherit from their parents. This, in turn, led\nto a guess that human ancestors split from chimpanzees\nbetween 4 and 6 million years ago.\nWhen fossil-hunters hear this number, they cry foul.\n“Geneticists ignored the palaeontologists completely.”\nsays Owen Lovejoy of Kent State University in Ohio. “To\nclaim a 4 million divergence date is just silly.”\nSimply put, the palaeontologists were sure, on the basis\nof fossil evidence, that there was little chance the DNA\nresults were accurate. Humanity, they affirmed, had to be\nolder than the geneticists claimed.\nHistory looks set to prove them right. In the past few\nyears, researchers studying human populations have for\nthe first time been able to observe mutations almost as\nthey happen. Instead of relying on an estimate based on\nrare fossils, we can now watch the molecular clock ticking\nin real time.\nIn 2012, Augustine Kong of Decode Genetics in Reykjavik, Iceland, and colleagues published a ground-breaking\nstudy. After scanning the genome of 78 children and their\nparents to count the number of new mutations in each\nchild’s genome, they found that each child carries an average of 36 new mutations. Crucially, that is half what was\npreviously assumed, meaning the molecular clock ticks\nmore slowly than we thought, pushing the human–chimp\nsplit further back in time.\nThis has consequences for other aspects of human prehistory. In particular, early genetic estimates suggested\nthat our ancestors left Africa 50,000 years ago. So when\nfossil remains in Israel and archaeological sites in India\nwere found to be around 100,000 years old, there was\nsome explaining to do. The Israeli bones were dismissed\nas the remains of an early dead-end excursion, and the\nIndian sites as an error, pure and simple. The new molecular clock resolves the discrepancy, pushing the departure from Africa back to between 90,000 and 130,000\nyears ago.\nOther key events await revision. But the main finding\nis clear. The human lineage is significantly older, and our\nclosest living relatives more distant, than we once thought.\nWe are used to thinking about ourselves as separate and\ndistinct from the rest of the animal kingdom. We just got\na bit more separate, and a bit more distinct.\nCatherine Brahic, New Scientist", "id": ""}
