Cause and effect were not yet prerequisites of childhood when I was growing up in the early\n‘50s in a small do-nothing town in western Massachusetts.\nThere were overheard dinner-table conversations about an\nepidemic, and forced March of Dimes collections with\nmy mother, but polio was a pretty vague menace for a\nlively kid with trouble to get into. Vague, that is, until my\nfriend’s sister caught the virus, and it became anything\nbut, and the whole town stunned, pitched in to send her\nto Boston to be saved.\nThis memory and so many others – of coming of age\n(or trying to) in a time when national and family and personal values really were different – have been revived for\nme, courtesy of Susan Richards Shreve in Warm Springs,\nher sensitive account of the two years she spent between\n1950 and 1952 at the polio rehabilitation hospital established by Franklin Roosevelt in the early 1920s in Warm\nSprings, Georgia.\nThe bare-bone facts of this tender memoir are these:\nShreve contracts paralytic polio when she is one, leaving\nher right side largely paralyzed, though she is eventually\nable to walk with braces. Her parents – mother, loving\nand indomitable; father, loving and distant – accept the\nfact of her illness but not necessarily its handicaps. Her\nmother devises exercise after exercise to spark new life in\nher daughter’s leg, turning the do-it-yourself restoration\nregime into a game. Shreve attends school, plays sport and\ngoes to camp just like other children, except she is not\nphysically just like other children. When she is 11, in 1950,\nshe travels to Warm Springs in the hope that when the\ndoctors and therapists are done with her, she will be just\nlike other children. During two stays there, she develops\ncrushes on a boy named Joey and a priest named Father\nJames, flirts with Catholicism, has muscles transplanted,\ndefies accepted Southern racial customs, experiences her\nfirst period, wears a sanitary belt round her neck into the\nBay’s Ward, and engages in a disastrous wheelchair race\nand is sent home in disgrace.\nShreve is a novelist who has approached her story with\na reporter’s eye. She has done her research on polio and\nWarm Springs, weaving the history of this once-dreaded\ndisease unobtrusively into her own. But it is the diligent\nway in which she has re-examined herself as the girl she was\nfrom the perspective of the woman she has become (“the\ntruth of this story is in the way I see it now”), and fitting\nthe girl back into a time and place a half-century gone, that\ndistinguishes Warm Springs from so many of the verticalpronoun bores arriving at bookstores these days.\nFor example, Shreve on Shreve: “By inclination I was\nunsurprised by failure, and good at it, and even felt a kind\nof satisfaction in the resilience required to bounce back, as\nif the failure itself were lengthening my chances of survival. But I also expected to win, and the two were strangely\ncomplementary in my mind”. For all the investigations\nShreve did of herself, interestingly, she did not seek out\nany of her fellow patients, an omission of commission,\nshe says: “A reason, maybe the real reason, I never made\nan effort to be in touch with these people, who were so\ncentral to me for an important period of my growing up,\nis part of the reason I wanted to write this book in the\nfirst place. Not so much to discover anyone I’d lost, but to\nunderstand why I wanted to lose them.” Or as she writes\nlater: “It was, I think, a place to be ‘in the moment’. And\nafter the moment it was time to be someplace else.”\nOf her present self, except as defined by her girl self,\nShreve is circumspect: she has married, had children,\ndivorced, written novels. Of her physical self, there is\nnothing. Though that’s not the story Warm Springs sets\nout to tell, when I finished the book, and to Shreve’s credit, I still wanted to know more about what had become\nof the girl who left Georgia with her right leg three and a\nhalf inches shorter than her left one.\nAbbott Combes, The New York Times Book Review", "id": ""}
