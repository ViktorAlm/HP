It must feel\nas if they are fghting a losing battle against secularisation\nand sexual liberation, trends that are in fashion even on\nthe political right. As the West has grown richer in the\npast 50 years, so the old bonds of organised religion and\npatriarchy have loosened. Tere is a contemporary ‘End of\nHistory’ consensus that things like gay rights or abortion\nare not just worthy causes or inalienable rights but are the\nend goal of a grand historical process.\nTake the dramatic evolution in English moral standards from the Georgians to the Victorians. England in the\n18th century was a surprisingly transgressive place. Pornographic literature was popular and erotic manuals were\nread aloud in alehouses. Homosexuality was fashionable\namong gentlemen. Contraceptives were sold brazenly in\nCovent Garden. Gossipy rags like Characters of the Present\nMost Celebrated Courtesans provided titillating cartoons of\nrich women brought low by greed and desire. One such\nvictim was described as ‘expensive in dress, extravagant in\nthe indulgence of her palate, violently addicted to wine\nand strong liquors which she often drinks to excess, not\ninfrequently to intoxication’.\nYet by the middle of the 19th century a popular reassertion of traditional Judeo-Christian morality had\ntransformed English mores and manners. Of course the\nVictorians were every bit as prone to vice as the Georgians\nhad been – even Queen Victoria collected nude male fgure drawings. Sex did not vanish in Victorian England but\nit was certainly idealised and privatised in a novel manner. Te Victorians scrubbed the public sphere clean of\nsensuality – with a combination of social regulation and\nmass-marketed carbolic soap. Sexual energy was redirected\ntowards the monogamous family unit and new normative\nvalues were created.\nIt is tempting to blame these changes on the prudery\nof an establishment desperate to re-assert control. King\nGeorge III led the charge with his 1787 Proclamation for the\nEncouragement of Piety and Virtue, and for the Preventing\nand Punishing of Vice, Profaneness and Immorality – an\nexhortation against pornography that later became the 1857\nObscene Publications Act. Tis coincided with an efort to\nenforce a bourgeois sexual order upon an urban working\nclass, swollen in number by the Industrial Revolution.\nBut we should not dismiss a complex and genuine desire\nto improve. Te new middle class saw a link between economics and morality that the Georgian aristocracy had not.\nTey believed that hard work and abstinence could improve\npeople, whereas decadence fostered indolence, disease and\npoverty. By 1900 there were upwards of 300 asylums for\n‘fallen women’ in England, providing a mix of protection\nand backbreaking labour for rescued prostitutes. Te asylums attested to a popular new sense of civic virtue that\nsought to rescue people from themselves. It had a protofeminist edge, protecting women against the masculine\nlusts that had run amok in the 18th century and objectifed\nwomen as lascivious Fanny Hills. Te ethics of Christian\ncapitalism gripped Britain well into the 1960s.\nTe past is littered with examples of cultural reaction:\nthe shah’s modernist Iran gave way to the ayatollah’s theocracy; the French Revolution was followed by Termidorean conservativism. Tere is rarely a pattern to dissect, but in the case of the Victorian reaction there are\ncertain parallels to today. Te credit crunch has obtained\na moral dimension in the hands of the US Tea Party and\ntraditional critics, who see it as the material collapse of an\ninsatiably greedy society – greedy for credit and the instant\ngratifcation that it brings. As a new economic order arises,\nwe might see the re-emergence of corresponding values\nof piety and sexual restraint. Whatever happens, liberals\ncannot rest on the assumption that liberty always expands\nover time. Calamity and change can cause it to contract\nin the blink of an eye.\nTim Stanley, History Today", "id": ""}
