Autism People with autism are often unable to judge when a face conveys emotions such as happiness or sadness, and many researchers take this as evidence that autism involves serious deficits in processing social information. Yet the voice, too, can provide emotional cues, and several recent studies indicate that when listening to voices, people with autism can actually recognize feelings and other traits of humanness as well as – or even better than – neurotypical people do. The studies suggest that at least for some subgroups of autistic people in certain situations, deficits in identifying emotions could be confined primarily to vision. ‘This is great news from a treatment perspective,’ says researcher Kevin Pelphrey at George Washington University. ‘It is much easier to help someone overcome an inability to read emotion from faces than it would be to treat a fundamental lack of understanding of emotion from all modalities.’ China Today Once again, as a thousand years ago, China leads the world in many ways. For example, they are global leaders in genetic engineering, the Chinese government directing billions of dollars towards research into modifying genes of crops, animals and even humans. China also leads the world in mobile banking, spending on luxury goods, high-speed rail, car manufacture, foreign trade, the export of machinery and electronic products – and in the size of its art market. It has the planet’s largest number of broadband subscribers, and is ahead in both solar and wind industry, as well as in the use of methanol as an alternative fuel.

Restless Legs Syndrome Glaxo Smith Kline made restless legs syndrome – a disorder characterized in part by the urge to move one’s legs at night – a household term in 2003, when it ran a vigorous awareness campaign for the disorder. The pharmaceutical company began by issuing press releases about presentations given at the 2003 annual meeting for the American Academy of Neurology, a professional society representing neurologists and neuroscientists. Two months later it distributed another press release, for a company-funded, as yet unpublished study, entitled “New survey reveals common yet under-recognized disorder – restless legs syndrome – is keeping Americans awake at night.” The press releases led to a slew of media coverage of the disorder; according to an analysis in 2006, one fifth of all articles written about it referred readers to the nonprofit Restless Legs Syndrome Foundation for more information, an organization that is heavily subsidized by Glaxo Smith Kline."]], "questions": ["33.

Within the span of two centuries, in three\nseparate regions of Eurasia, spiritual movements emerged\nthat would give rise to the world’s major moral religions,\nthose preaching some combination of compassion, humility and asceticism. Scholars often attribute the rise of\nthese moral religions – Buddhism, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism and Christianity included – to population growth,\nseeing morality as a necessary social stabilizer in increasingly large and volatile human communities. Yet findings\nfrom a recent study published in Current Biology point to\na different factor: rising affluence.\nThe authors investigated variables relating to political complexity and living standards. Affluence emerged\nas a major force in the rise of moral religion – in particular, access to energy. Across cultures, moral religions\nabruptly emerged when members of a population could\nreliably source 20,000 calories of energy a day, including\nfood (for humans and livestock), fuel and raw materials.\n“This number appears to correspond with a certain\npeace of mind,” says lead author Nicolas Baumard, a\nresearch scientist at École Normale Supérieure in Paris.\n“Having a roof over your head, not feeling like the world\nis full of predators and enemies, knowing that you’ll have\nenough to eat tomorrow.” As Baumard points out, psychology research shows that affluence appears to influence our motivations and reward circuitry away from\nshort-term gain to also considering the benefits of longterm strategy. In other words, with a steady energy supply, we had more time to cooperate, cultivate skills and\nconsider consequences. Affluence also allowed more time\nfor existential pondering: maybe we have some greater\nmoral responsibility; perhaps life has a purpose.\nBaumard acknowledges that moral and ascetic qualities probably existed in humans before the major religions emphasized them. Other experts believe that the\npaper may not consider these inherent qualities seriously\nenough. Barbara King, an anthropologist at the college of\nWilliam & Mary, argues that the study exaggerates the\nsharp transition to the moral belief systems. She suggests\nthat a more gradual transition may have taken place – one\nthat was perhaps nudged over the line by a reliable calorie count. “Anthropologists and psychologists have found\ndeep roots of compassion and morality in other primates,”\nKing explains. “I don’t see any reason to assume that cosmological morality and compassion were not important\nto earlier hunter-gatherer groups.”\nBernard J. Crespi, an evolutionary biologist at Simon\nFraser University in British Columbia, also cautions\nagainst Baumard’s claim: “The main idea in the article is\nfascinating, but the causal link between increasing affluence and religion remains to be established. Our work\nactually suggests that the authors might have their causality reversed – that religion itself drives increases in\naffluence via its effects on increased cooperation.”\nStill, Baumard’s findings point to a strong association\nbetween affluence and the emergence of moral religion,\nspecifically. Plenty of ancient societies cooperated and\nhad religious beliefs – the Maya, Sumerians and Egyptians among them. For the most part, however, none of\nthese societies’ belief systems emphasized morality, or\nmaterial and visceral restraint. And according to Baumard, members of these societies never had access to\nmore than 15,000 calories a day. Whether cause or effect,\nmorality, it seems, takes energy.\nBret Stetka, Scientific American Mind", "id": ""}
