What is Arthur Allen’s view of the present situation concerning vaccination in the United States?"], "article": "In 1796, an English country doctor named Edward Jenner successfully immunized a child against smallpox, the\nworld’s deadliest infectious disease. News of Jenner’s stunning achievement led millions throughout Europe to roll\nup their sleeves. Yet, as Arthur Allen makes clear in Vaccine, a timely, fair-minded and crisply written account\nof “medicine’s greatest lifesaver,” not everyone welcomed\nJenner’s feat. Criticism came quickly, often in apocalyptic\nterms. Te economist Tomas Malthus wrote that vaccination might lead to dangerous population increases.\nMinisters warned against interfering against the Lord’s\ngrand design. Others, meanwhile, objected to a process\nthat injected foreign, perhaps poisonous, matter into the\nbody. What possible good could come from polluting the\nbloodstream of a child?\nAntivaccine sentiment found fertile soil in the United\nStates, where the ethos of individual responsibility often\nclashed with public health programs based on collective\nnorms. What kept vaccine opponents on the defensive,\nhowever, were the rapid breakthroughs in medicine and\npublic health. Jenner’s triumph was followed by a procession of other vaccines, for rabies, tetanus, yellow fever,\ndiphtheria, and more. A healthier diet, advances in sanitation and surgery, the development of antibiotics and\nDDT – all combined to increase American life expectancy\nto 70 years from 47 between 1900 and 1955.\nWorld War II made vaccination fashionable. Polio\nturned it into a national crusade. No disease drew as much\nattention in postwar America, or created as much fear.\nPrimarily striking children, polio killed some of its victims\nand paralyzed others, leaving behind vivid reminders for\nall to see: wheelchairs, leg braces, iron lungs, deformed\nlimbs. Te quest for a means of prevention led to the largest public health experiment in American history, involving nearly two million school-age volunteers. When\nJonas Salk’s virus vaccine was declared “safe, efective and\npotent” in 1955, the nation celebrated as if a war had ended\n– and, indeed, one had.\nAs late as the 1950s, parents had been encouraged to expose\ntheir children to diseases like measles and mumps in order\nto get them over with before adulthood, when the dangers\nincreased. Vaccines for these illnesses have been around\nsince the 1970s. More were on the way and some researchers spoke openly about a future without infectious disease.\nIn our current age of AIDS, one marvels at the arrogance\nof such a belief. Nature remains a full step ahead.\nAllen is sympathetic to parental fears regarding the dangers of various vaccines, though he remains skeptical that\nscientifc studies of these dangers will open many minds.\nAt this point, he writes, much of the “antivaccinist” leadership is composed of countercultural types who view life\nthrough the prism of conspiracy theory: the government\nlies, the drug companies are evil, the medical profession is\ncorrupt; trust the Internet instead. A fair number oppose\ntraditional medicine in favor of homeopathy, believing\nthat vaccines weaken the immune system and that sickness\nis a natural part of life.\nTo a large extent, says Allen, this antivaccination\nimpulse is fueled by an ignorance of the past. Vaccines\nhave done their job so well that most parents today are\nblissfully unaware of the diseases their children are inoculated against. Te end result is a culture that has become\nincreasingly risk-averse regarding vaccination because people have greater trouble grasping the reward.\nTe problem appears to be growing. As more children\ngo unvaccinated in the United States, there has been a rise\nin vaccine-preventable diseases. Meanwhile, fewer pharmaceutical companies are now producing vaccines, citing\nthe high cost of testing, diminishing markets and a fear of\nlitigation. For Allen, a reversal of these trends will require\nsomething long overdue: a frank national discussion about\nthe risks and benefts of vaccination. His splendid book is\na smart place to begin.\nDavid Oshinsky, The New York Times Book Review", "id": ""}
