At the time, reading was a\npublic activity; the literate elite, being a rare commodity,\nwould read the Bible aloud to the illiterate masses as a\npublic service. Socrates, many intellectuals’ role model,\nwas in all likelihood illiterate.\nToday we are readers. Evidence suggests that reading –\nwhich depends on an alphabet, writing materials, papyrus\nand such – is only about 5000 years old. The brain in its\nmodern form is about 200,000 years old, yet brain imaging shows reading taking place in the same way and in\nthe same place in all brains. To within a few millimetres,\nhuman brains share a reading hotspot – what Stanislas\nDehaene calls the “letterbox” – on the bottom of the left\nhemisphere.\nDehaene builds his clear and interesting book around\nwhat he calls the “reading paradox”, which is really more\npuzzle than paradox. It is standard procedure in cognitive\nneuroscience to assume that a brain area dedicated to a particular function – especially when it is universal – is an\nadaptation that evolved to serve a function related to reproductive success. The letterbox, however, cannot be an adaptation because reading is an utterly recent invention, unlike\nneurological abilities for language and socialising that were\naround long enough to have evolved. What’s more, the letterbox does not ride on top of areas used for speech. Instead,\nit must be an “exaptation”: a brain area that evolved to do\none thing but has been co-opted to do another.\nDehaene calls this the “neuronal recycling hypothesis”,\nwhich he enjoys announcing to considerable fanfare as a\n“novel” solution to the reading puzzle, though many neuroscientists have turned to exaptations to solve such mysteries. He sees the hypothesis as staking a middle ground\nbetween tabula-rasa (the mind as an empty slate) and hardwired-determinist views (the mind as pre-programmed) of\nhuman nature. The neuronal recycling hypothesis is the\nidea that “human brain architecture obeys strong genetic\nconstraints, but some circuits have evolved to tolerate a\nfringe of variability”, Dehaene writes. “Part of our visual\nsystem, for instance, is not hard-wired, but remains open\nto changes in the environment. Within an otherwise wellstructured brain, visual plasticity gave the ancient scribes\nthe opportunity to invent reading.”\nSo what did the reading module originally evolve for?\nDehaene lets the answer to this question remain a mystery\nuntil the end, while he takes the reader on a fascinating\ntour of the neuroscience of reading. It is a rich and comprehensive book by a clear writer and a fine scientist.\nEventually we get the solution, admittedly speculative,\nto the puzzle. The area that reading co-opted originally\nevolved for the visual acuity needed to track animals, a\nskill with obvious survival benefits. Some of the evidence\nfor this comes from studying line, edge and curve detection in the letterbox area, which also explains universal\nvisual features of all alphabets.\nDid we lose the capacity to track because reading has\nco-opted this neural space? Has our capacity to “read”\npatterns in nature diminished? Here Dehaene is hard to\npin down. The brain has so much computing power that\nit seems doubtful that reading has knocked out the original ability.\nI would also have liked Dehaene to speculate on the\nfuture of reading. Some think reading will become obsolete\nas new technologies reutilise pictorial and auditory routes to\ndo for us what reading does. What will culture and the brain\nconspire to do next? We may be figuring out how brains\nread just when we are on the verge of returning to living as\nvery smart souls who don’t read. Socrates redux.\nOwen Flanagan, New Scientist", "id": ""}
