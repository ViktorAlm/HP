It’s not legit.’\nAnd she was right. With a vocal range barely stretching\nbeyond an octave, she really could only go up and down\n‘a little bit’, and she wouldn’t have lasted a day at any of\nthe conservatories that trained aspiring singers in the ‘legit’ techniques of classical or operatic performance. Since\nHoliday was incapable of the vocal gymnastics displayed\nby the likes of Sarah Vaughan and Ella Fitzgerald, her\nplace in the first rank of jazz singers surely rests on other qualities. It’s in drawing those out that John Szwed’s\nbook is at its most valuable.\nThe familiar view has it that what imbued Holiday’s\nsinging with such power and profundity, despite the obvious limitations of her voice, was a kind of personal authenticity. What Szwed calls the ‘myth’ of Billie Holiday\n– the pastiche of tragedy that built up around her during\nthe course of her career and that has been recycled ever\nsince her death in 1959, at the age of forty-four – makes\nthe very real pain of her often tortured existence the key\nto understanding her art. She lived the emotions she sang\nof, it has been claimed, and her years of addiction, abuse\nand exploitation by lovers, record companies and the police infuse her singing with a raw honesty that speaks to\nus from the depth of her soul. The impulse to attribute\nher music’s power to its autobiographical veracity has\nbeen too much for most of her life’s chroniclers on page\nand screen to resist.\nSzwed, however, has the courage and imagination to\nquestion whether ‘real suffering’ is ‘necessary for great\nsinging’ – even for great singing about suffering. A skilful singer can ‘simulate emotions by a catch in the throat,\nupper-register pyrotechnics, or vibrato’, he writes, and\nmust be able to communicate a panoply of emotions by\ndeveloping a ‘dramatic sensibility’. Singing, in other\nwords, involves acting. And even if, as seems indisputable, Holiday did bring tremendous emotional intensity\nto bear on her singing, emotion does not automatically\ntranslate into great music. What can achieve that translation is a combination of taste and technique, two qualities that, Szwed argues, Holiday possessed in abundance.\nTo think of Holiday as having ‘technique’ already takes\nus beyond the formula of technical limitations plus emotional sincerity that has governed so much discussion of\nher music, and Szwed pays Holiday a high compliment\nby focusing less on her authenticity than on her artistry.\nHer powers of rhythmic and melodic invention were legendary among the musicians she played with. Her spontaneous adaptations of well-known tunes, often necessitated by her need to compress a song’s range, were themselves improvisations of the highest standard, sometimes\nproducing entirely new melodies.\nThen there was her way with rhythm. ‘Lagging’, or\nplaying behind the beat, was already a common device\nof jazz musicians when Holiday began recording in the\n1930s, but the exceptionally pronounced delay she often\nused took her early accompanists by surprise. No less\ninnovative was her approach to accenting and phrasing\nlyrics, often placing the stress in unexpected places and,\nSzwed suggests, adding an almost abstract dimension to\nwords by employing them not only in their representational sense but also, through accentuation and modification, as pure sound that conveyed its own meanings.\nEmotion was indeed a hallmark of her singing, but it was\nthrough these sharply honed techniques and imaginative\nleaps that emotion was wrought into beautiful music.\nThis is a curious book, though. Billed as a biography\non its dust jacket, in reality it’s anything but. Szwed feels\nobliged to tackle the ‘myth’ of Holiday in the first, and\nshorter, of the book’s two sections, but these chapters\nhave a rather ragbag character, with little sense of narrative progression. It’s not at all clear why we’re given a\nvignette about the party antics of Woolworth heir Jimmy\nDonahue, or potted biographies of various other peripheral figures, when we’re told scarcely the basics about\nHoliday’s early years. It’s only when Szwed moves on to\nthe ‘musician’ that the book comes into its own – though\neven then, what fascinates him seems to be less the musician than the voice.\nDaniel Matlin, Literary Review", "id": ""}
