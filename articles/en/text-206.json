Childhood, on the\nother hand, began in the seventeenth century – or so the\nsocial historians of the 1960s and 1970s would have us\nbelieve. According to them, ‘in medieval society the idea\nof childhood did not exist’; children were simply regarded\nas ‘small and inadequate adults’, who dressed, worked and\nlived like their elders. As many of them died young and\nmost were sent away from home at a very early age to serve\nin other households, parents could not afford to get too\nclose to their offspring and treated them with a detachment\nand lack of sympathy that would be considered reprehensible today. The logical conclusion to be drawn from this\nis that the concept of childhood as something distinct and\ndifferent from adulthood is a modern invention.\nIn his informative and entertaining study, Nicholas\nOrme challenges this assumption and convincingly argues\nthat it is not merely flawed but untenable. Unlike his predecessors in the field, who principally relied on iconographical material, Orme has cast his net wide and drawn\non a remarkable variety of medieval sources. His meticulous research allows an immensely detailed examination\nof every aspect of childhood, beginning in the womb and\nending with the progression to adulthood. The result is a\nbook that is nominally about children but actually covers\nevery aspect of medieval life, from the impact of Church\nand State decrees down to the minutiae of the highly complex medieval alphabet.\nAs Orme demonstrates, childhood was recognised as\na distinct state in both religious and secular law from\nabout 1200. Before puberty, children were exempted from\nmaking confession, receiving Communion, paying tithes\nand church dues and were deemed unable to get married fully and permanently. Child weddings were frowned\nupon and the Church refused to consider such marriages\nas binding until the couple reached puberty and could give\ntheir own informed consent. Two children from Cheshire\nwho were married in 1552 aged two and three (the groom\nbeing so young he had to be carried in his uncle’s arms\nand have his vows said on his behalf) refused to ratify their\nmarriage when they came of age and it therefore had to\nbe annulled.\nIn fact, such instances of very young children being\ntreated as if they were adults were rare and usually confined to the rich, who had properties and dynasties to\nprotect. As Orme ably points out, even in the medieval\nperiod children did not emerge from their parents’ shadow until their twenties; apprentices came out of service\nat that age, clerks could only be made priests at twentyfour and those of noble birth could not inherit until\ntwentyone. Because they lacked financial independence,\nit was impractical for them to marry before they attained\nmajority, and most did not.\nChildren were provided with toys: archaeological examples of spinning tops survive from the eleventh century,\nand mass-produced knights on horseback (made from an\nalloy of lead and tin) from the reign of Edward I. They had\ntheir own songs, games and riddles, depicted in manuscript\nilluminations and preserved in school notebooks. Then, as\nnow, their youthful exuberance irritated their elders. The\ndean and chapter of Exeter Cathedral complained bitterly\nin 1448 about the ‘young persons’ who used their cloister\nfor playing with ‘the top, queck, penny prick, and most\nat tennis, by which the walls of the said cloister have been\ndefouled and the glass windows all burst asunder’.\nIt is this wealth of detail and lively anecdote that makes\nMedieval Children so rewarding and stimulating. In less\nsure hands, it might have been overwhelming, but Orme’s\nprose is clear and concise and he never loses sight of the\nthemes that underpin his book. Special credit should also\nbe given to his publishers, Yale University Press, who have\ncomplemented his text with an equally rich collection of\nillustrations. This book is a treasure trove, full of gems,\neven for the non-medievalist.\nJuliet Barker, Literary Review", "id": ""}
