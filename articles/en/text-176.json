Staff\nat the HQ of the Metropolitan Police use so much lighting, heating, cooling and electricity that the tower pumps\nout 13,491 tonnes of carbon dioxide a year – equivalent to\nabout 2,200 households. It makes it the most polluting\npolice station in England and Wales and one of the biggest\ncontributors to greenhouse gases of any public building\nin Britain.\nAnimal Life\nIt took a mere 85 million years – the geologic blink of an\neye – for animals to evolve and radiate out over much of\nthe world’s land and oceans. Although fossil records and\nmolecular biology have provided much information on\nthe spread of animal life, scientists have not been able to\nfigure out exactly what sparked this massive diversification. New research shows that nutrient-rich runoff from\nmassive melting glaciers may have provided the extra\nenergy needed to fuel this dramatic evolution.", "id": ""}
