If you want to improve the way children behave in school – for instance, by making them more\ndiligent and less disruptive in the classroom – then improving their home environment is not the way to do it. What\nyou need is a school-based intervention. That is where the\nteachers have power. A talented teacher can influence a\nwhole group of kids. The teacher’s biggest challenge is to\nkeep this group of kids from splitting up into two opposing fractions: one pro-school and pro-learning, the other\nanti-school and anti-learning. When that happens, the\ndifferences between the groups widen.\nReligious Thoughts\nReligious belief may seem to be a unique psychological experience, but a growing body of research shows that thinking\nabout religion is no different from thinking about secular\nthings – at least from the standpoint of the brain. In the\nfirst imaging study to compare religious and non-religious\nthoughts, evaluating the truth of either type of statement\nwas found to involve the same regions of the brain.", "id": ""}
