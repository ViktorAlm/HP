Laypeople come to\nscience with their own systematic ideas often far removed\nfrom scientific ones. To explain science effectively, we need\nto start from these everyday intuitions and move readers\ntowards the scientific concepts. Yet we often end up simply\nreinforcing the initial intuitions rather than overturning\nthem. No matter how carefully we report and interpret,\nthe reader’s final picture will often be quite different from\nthe one we set out to paint.\nPopular science may even create fabulous intellectual monsters: chimeras of scientific and everyday ideas\nthat take on a life of their own. One example is the way\nresearch on the lateralisation of brain function has been\nhugely oversimplified into the idea that right and left brain\ncontrol different skills.\nThe real problem arises when it comes to the human\nsciences of biology, psychology or neurology. Everyone has\nbeliefs about human nature, and often those beliefs have\ndeep social and political roots and implications. Scientific\npsychologists need both to engage with those beliefs and\nrevise them.\nAll of the above is a preamble to thinking about two\nbooks that exemplify the science writer’s dilemma: Daniel\nGoleman’s Social Intelligence and Howard Gardner’s Multiple\nIntelligences. For me they are simultaneously attractive and\ntroubling because they come to challenge popular intuitions\nabout “intelligence” but may end up reinforcing them.\nThe attractions first. Both writers are effective popularisers of science, and both books are clear, informative and\nreadable in different ways. Goleman’s is anecdotal and journalistic, covering a very wide range of research, while Gardner is elegant and magisterial about his own earlier research.\nNow for the troublesome bit – and the dilemma.\nWhat’s intelligence got to do with it? There seems to be\na popular fascination, not to say obsession, with the idea\nof intelligence. But outside of a narrow subfield within\npsychometrics, “intelligence” simply does not play a role\nin current scientific views of the mind.\nThe lay concept of “intelligence” is of a kind of substance, of “stuff”, that different people have in different\ndegrees, like cholesterol or blood sugar. By contrast, the\nscientific concept of “cognition” involves complex interactions between many varied computational and neurological mechanisms with long developmental histories. Ultimately, these complex interactions allow people\nto make their way in the world. The popular concept of\n“intelligence” is much like the popular biological concepts\nof “energy” or “vitality”: it sees a complicated set of functional relations as a single force.\nMost developmental or cognitive psychologists simply\ndo not talk about intelligence at all, singular or plural.\nThey talk, rather, about “intuitive systems” of knowledge,\nsuch as “folk” theories of psychology or physics or number\nsystems or grammars that allow us to make both predications and generalisations. Or they talk about computational capacities such as causal inference, or statistical\ninduction, which enable us to learn these intuitive systems. However, none of these mechanisms divides neatly\ninto “types” of intelligence.\nGoleman and Gardner recognise this divide between\nintuitive and scientific ideas. In fact, it was clearly the\nmotivation for Gardner’s original work. And yet, as Gardner himself sometimes ruefully remarks, the very success of the “multiple intelligences” idea suggests that the\naudience really does not get it. Rather than seeing that\nintelligence is not a substance at all, people now seem\nto think it is several substances – social, emotional and\nlogico-mathematical.\nNo wonder people are glad to hear that there is more\nintelligence around than they thought. Talking about\n“emotional intelligence” or “social intelligence” is like\ntalking about “the nobility of labour” or “being a gentleman”. It is a way of softening the brutal realities of an arbitrary scholastic pecking order. This is a more attractive and\nhumane picture of intelligence than the genetic scarcity\npicture painted earlier, for example in The Bell Curve, by\npsychologist Richard J. Herrnstein and political scientist\nCharles Murray from 1994, but it may be just as removed\nfrom what Goleman and Gardner intended.\nAlison Gopnik, New Scientist", "id": ""}
