Another was how, despite ceding many of his\nfamily’s business holdings after the 1949 revolution, and\nlosing the rest during the Cultural Revolution of 1966–76,\nhe emerged within a decade as one of the 50 most charismatic businessmen in the world, by Fortune’s reckoning,\nand by 1999, by Forbes’, as China’s richest.\nTh e answer to both these mysteries is that he played\na very clever and very Chinese game. First, when most\nof his family, including his brothers, fl ed from China to\nTaiwan or the United States after 1949, Mr Rong stayed.\nHe had 24 fl our mills to run, besides dyeing, printing and\ntextile factories, employing in all some 80,000 people; his\nfamily’s business empire, started in 1902, had been among\nthe biggest in the country.\nTh e decision not to fl ee was brave, and made him\nnervous: he was “like an ant on a hot pan”, he said later,\nbut stayed calm in front of the workforce. He also presented himself, from the fi rst, as one of those “national”\nor “patriotic” capitalists who had remained not to enrich\nhimself, but to help China and its poverty. His dogged\nconviction that his country would eventually fi nd capitalism necessary was to be proved right in spades.\nMr Rong’s communism was subtle. He supported the\nCommunists, he admitted, with only “one hand” at fi rst.\nBut when he realised that this would not do, he raised\ntwo, with implicit conditions. If he gave the party what it\nwanted, he would try to make sure the favour was returned. After 1956, when he handed over large stakes in his\nfamily’s businesses to the government, he was given 30m\nYuan ($12m) in compensation, as well as the posts of vicemayor of Shanghai and, in 1959, vice-minister for the textile industry.\nHaving gained political ties from canny surrenders, Mr\nRong made sure he used them. Guanxi, or personal connections, the grease of all commerce and politics in China,\nhelped him to survive the Cultural Revolution, more or\nless. Th ough his companies were confi scated, his mansions\nransacked, and he himself reduced to menial work, top\nmembers of the party shielded him from further terrors.\nIn 1978, all the years of careful positioning bore fruit.\nDeng Xiaoping decided that China would experiment\nwith capitalism, opening windows to the world, and\nbrought in Mr Rong to fi nd “boldly creative” ways of\ndoing so. He could have picked no better one: urbane,\nbeautifully turned out, educated under the British system\nat St John’s University in Shanghai, a man impeccably\nloyal to China and to Deng, but also a raging capitalist to\nhis very marrow.\nMr Rong, now in his dream job, did not have to look\nfar to fi nd versions of capitalism he liked. In 1979, at the\nparty’s behest, he founded CITIC, ostensibly as the investment arm of the Chinese state but also, in eff ect, his own\ncompany. From its very beginnings it was in clover, a statelicensed predator in a land empty of private rivals. Telecoms, utilities and highways were swept up. When Deng\nin the 1980s set up the Special Economic Zones in southern China, where capitalist forays were permitted, CITIC\nwas fi rst there to exploit the property boom. Mr Rong,\nroving extensively, found foreign concerns for China to\ninvest in, and foreign investors were in turn lured back to\nChina. Mr Rong’s conglomerate soon boasted global assets\nof more than 51 billion Yuan and 200 affi liated enterprises,\nincluding airlines, Hong Kong banks, timber operations\nand Australian aluminium smelting.\nTo what extent public assets leached into private income\nwas something the Chinese government could never quite\nfi nd out. Certainly it had no system of rules to stop it.\nOnce the dragon of capitalism, even in the safe and suave\nform of Mr Rong, was let in through the door, government and markets mingled.\nThe Economist", "id": ""}
