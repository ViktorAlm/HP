Although a few Africans rose to positions of power\nin India, some even establishing small kingdoms, most\nentered the country as slaves. Their descendants are found\ntoday in Gujarat and along the southern coast. But little\nis known about those slaves shipped in through Bombay\nand Karachi and taken eastwards to be sold.\nAnecdotal stories of African soldiers fighting against\nthe British during the Indian Mutiny (also known as the\nIndian Uprising) occur in military memoirs and particularly those from Oudh, the last princely state to be\nannexed by the East India Company. The two events, the\nannexation in 1856 followed by the mutiny of 1857–58, are\nclosely connected. Many of the Indian troops who turned\nagainst their British officers came from Oudh. Although\nthere was much wrong in the kingdom, presided over by\nits last monarch the Nawab Wajid Ali Shah (1822–87),\nthe inhabitants preferred to be ruled by their own king,\nwhatever his faults, rather than by the British. This was\nsomething that Lord Dalhousie, the Governor General of\nIndia, had signally failed to appreciate when he ordered\nOudh to be annexed on the grounds of misrule.\nSome of the fiercest Mutiny fighting took place in its\ncapital, Lucknow, where the Nawab had recently created\na huge palace. During the siege and the subsequent recapture of the city in March 1858, African men and women\nwere involved in the thick of the street fighting. Why these\nmen and women supported their former master, the slaveowning Wajid Ali Shah, rather than the British, who had\nprohibited slavery, can be answered from British Government records in the Delhi National Archives.\nThere are fragmentary accounts of Africans in Lucknow\nbrought in by earlier rulers. Wajid Ali Shah’s great-grandfather, a keen horseman, had employed ‘habshi boys’ as\njockeys at the turn of the 19th century. A great-uncle had\nordered and bought 18 slaves, who arrived at Bombay in\nan Arab ship and who were brought overland in covered\ncarriages. Wajid Ali Shah’s own father ordered 200 swords\nfor his African troops. So the custom of employing Africans and an overland slave-trading route was already established. As many as 1,000 male and female African slaves\nmay have arrived in Lucknow in 1847 and 1848. Although\nAfricans were employed elsewhere in India, the Nawabs of\nOudh seem unique in importing women as well as men.\nIn 1860, with the British firmly back in control, the\nremaining Africans in Lucknow petitioned the Chief\nCommissioner for pensions. This was not a completely\nfutile hope because many people who had been dependent\non the Nawab for their livelihood did receive small sums\nfrom the British government in compensation for losing\ntheir source of income. However, the Africans’ petition\nwas turned down and over the next two decades their pleas\nbecame more urgent as their numbers dwindled. A large\nnumber were said to have died from starvation, while others had left the city.\nThe care and financial support given by the British\ngovernment to slaves in Bombay contrasts starkly with\nthe official indifference shown to the Africans in Lucknow.\nFor backing the ‘wrong side’ during the Mutiny they were\nstill being punished 20 years later. Only one sympathetic\nvoice was heard in their defence. Sir William Muir, head\nof the Intelligence Department during the Mutiny, declared in May 1877: “The fact that they fought against us at\nLucknow ought not to be brought against them – it was\nprobably natural; the fact that they fought bravely is surely\nin their favour!”\nAfrican men and women came to Oudh as slaves to\nsatisfy the whims of the last king, who then left them\nunprovided for when he was deposed. They fought bravely\nin the Mutiny, a fight which was not of their making, and\nhave been paying the price ever since.\nRosie Llewellyn-Jones, History Today", "id": ""}
