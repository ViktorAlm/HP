What is claimed here?", "39. How does the writer feel about Sheila Kitzinger’s views?", "40. What else does the text suggest?"], "article": "Economic Behaviour\nAlthough Plato compared the human soul to a chariot\ndrawn by the two horses of reason and emotion, modern\neconomics has mostly been a one-horse show: humans\nhave been assumed to be coolly rational calculators of\ntheir own self-interest. Over the past few years, evidence\nfrom psychology has persuaded many economists that reason does not always have its way. A burgeoning new fi eld\ndubbed “neuroeconomics” seems poised to provide fresh\ninsights on how Plato’s two horses together produce economic behaviour.\nIdentifying the parts of the brain that control economic\nactions is one thing. Harder tasks include determining\nhow neural systems work together to create behaviour and\nhow wide is the variation in brain patterns between diff erent people. Th en there are age-old questions of free will:\nis your failure to save for old age simply a lifestyle choice,\nor is it down to faulty brain circuits? Neuroeconomics\nis already providing fascinating conclusions. But Plato’s\nchariot will remain an alluring explanation for a while yet.\nGiving Birth\nTh ere is only one “good” way to give birth – and that is\n“naturally”, without pain re lief, preferably at home and\ncertainly not by caesarian section. At least that’s what I was\nleft thinking after reading natural childbirth guru Sheila\nKitzinger. She, of course, gave birth to her fi rst child in\njust two and a half hours, and says that she didn’t expect\na painless birth but knew that she could cope. And there\nstraight away is the funda men tal fl aw in the whole “natural” childbirth argument. Because the fact of the matter\nis that you don’t know what your labour will be like until\nyou’re in it, and anyone who thinks they can plan it could\nwell be in for a nasty shock. I know this because I was that\nwoman who thought she could do it “naturally”.", "id": ""}
