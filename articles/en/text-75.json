Teenage Brains Teenagers are wired differently from their parents and even their older siblings. Recent neuroscientific research indicates that the brain’s quotient of gray matter – neuron-filled tissue responsible for cognitive and emotional functions, among other tasks – peaks in adolescence. But relative to adults, teenagers are short on white matter, the tissue that ensures efficient and steady coordination throughout the brain. The connections between the rest of the brain and the frontal lobe, which is charged with foreseeing the consequences of one’s actions and differentiating between good and bad, do not fully form until one’s 20s. In the teenage years, the brain is all brawn. Toss this brain into the Internet’s social web, a sea so roiling that it sometimes proves unnavigable even for adults, and what do you get? The adolescent brain, according to neuroscientists, is likelier to seek smaller, earlier rewards than larger, later ones. With adolescence also comes a shift in the usual source of a child’s counsel. Adolescents begin to rely more on their peers for support and less on their parents and teachers. In effect, the endless fast feedback on social sites can nurture users’ worst tendencies. Young Conductors The appointment of Andris Nelsons as music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra (BSO) marks an end to more than three years in the wilderness for a venerable musical institution. At 35, Mr Nelsons will be the orchestra’s youngest director for more than a century. The appointment builds on a recent trend among America’s top ensembles for hiring leaders who could be the youngest people in the concert hall. For Mr Nelsons, this may represent a normal changing of the guard. But something else seems to be at work here. This new raft of conductors also reflects a wider desire to rebrand an art form that has come to be seen as the exclusive property of the greyhaired and well-heeled."]], "questions": ["33.

These ants also act as bodyguards, defending the\ntrees from hungry elephants and giraffes by biting and\nstinging them. Now, an invasive species known as the bigheaded ant is killing the native ants. The native ants put up\na brave fight, streaming out of the acacia trees to meet the\ninvaders, but the invasive species usually wins in a hostile\ntakeover of the trees, says Corinna Riginos, an ecologist\nat Teton Research Institute. “There are body parts strewn\neverywhere,” she says. The bigheaded ants, Pheidole megacephala, stay a while in the acacia trees before returning\nto their nests, preventing native species from recolonizing\nthe trees.\nReligious Belief\nRecent studies on twins, aimed to identify what determines religiosity, conclude that shared environment –\nnamely, a family’s approach to religion – plays a great\nrole, especially during childhood and adolescence. After\nthat, the picture shifts, the early environment becomes\nless potent, and a genetic influence emerges between the\nages of 18 and 25 years. The twin data suggest that genetic\nfactors help to explain why adults sometimes stray from\nthe beliefs of their childhood. The more distance they get\nfrom the beliefs of their early years, the more idiosyncratic\nfactors can hold sway over a person’s attitudes. In a way, we\nare born to be inclined toward religion or atheism.\nBosses\nIn gorilla society, power belongs to silverback males.\nThese splendid creatures have numerous status markers\nbesides their back hair: they are bigger than the rest of\ntheir band, strike space-filling postures, produce deeper\nsounds, thump their chests lustily and, in general, exude\nan air of physical fitness.\nIn the corporate world, the typical chief executive\nofficer (CEO) is more than six feet tall, has a deep voice,\na good posture, a touch of grey in his thick, lustrous hair\nand, for his age, a fit body. Bosses spread themselves out\nbehind their large desks. They stand tall when talking to\nsubordinates. Their conversation is laden with prestige\npauses and declarative statements.\nThe big difference between gorillas and humans is, of\ncourse, that human society changes rapidly. The past few\ndecades have seen a striking change in relative influence\n– between men and women, the West and the emerging\nworld, and between geeks and non-geeks. Women run\nsome of America’s largest firms. More than half of the\nworld’s biggest 2,500 public companies have their headquarters outside the West. Geeks barely out of short trousers run some of the world’s most dynamic businesses.\nPeter Thiel, one of Silicon Valley’s leading investors, has\nintroduced a blanket rule: never invest in a CEO who\nwears a suit.\nYet it is remarkable, in this supposed age of diversity,\nhow many bosses still conform to the stereotype, according to recent research. First, they are tall. People who\n“sound right” also have a marked advantage in the race\nfor the top. When people were asked to evaluate speeches\ndelivered by 120 executives, it was found that voice quality\naccounted for 23% of listeners’ evaluations and the content of the speech only accounted for 11%. Physical fitness\nseems to matter, too. Good posture makes people act like\nleaders as well as look like them.\nBesides relying on all these supposedly positive indicators\nof fitness to lead, those who choose bosses also rely on\nsome negative stereotypes. Overweight people are judged\nincapable of controlling themselves, let alone others.\nThose who “uptalk” – habitually ending their statements\non a high note as if asking a question – rule themselves\nout on the grounds that they sound tentative and juvenile.\nHigh-tech companies merrily abandon Mr Thiel’s rule\nonce they reach a certain size and recruit a besuited outsider as CEO. Female leaders have reacted in different\nways. Some have defined themselves by wearing power\nsuits and working long hours. Others have celebrated\nmotherhood.\nCan anything be done about this predisposition for\npromoting people of a certain type? Ideally, those selecting a new boss would conscientiously set aside all the\nstereotypes, and judge candidates purely on their merits.\nHowever, given a plethora of candidates, all with perfect\nCVs, selection committees continue to look for the “x”\nfactor and find, strangely enough, that it resides in people who look remarkably like themselves. Another solution is to introduce quotas for CEOs and board members.\nBut the risk is that this ends in tokenism rather than a\ngenuine equalising of opportunity. So, some management\nexperts suggest we just accept that stereotypes and prejudices cannot be wished away, and simply help those born\noutside the magic genetic circle project a sense of power\nand self-confidence.\nMore than a century ago, Oscar Wilde quipped: “It is\nonly shallow people who do not judge by appearances.”\nUnfortunately, those who choose leaders still seem to\nthink this way.\nThe Economist", "id": ""}
