Do\ngirls grow up and lose their edge, while boys mature and\ngain theirs?\nTen years ago, no one would have thought to ask. Th e\nassumption that boys dominated at school as well as at\nwork, while girls were silenced or ignored, seemed beyond\ndispute. But in her new book, Th e Sexual Paradox, a ringing salvo in the sex-diff erence wars, Susan Pinker stacks up\nthe evidence of boys’ classroom woes and girls’ triumphs.\n“In the United States, boys are three times as likely to be\nplaced in special education classes, twice as likely to repeat\na grade and a third more likely to drop out of high school,”\nshe writes. Tests of 15-year-olds in 30 European countries\nshow girls far outstripping boys in reading and writing\nand holding their own in math. Boys are overrepresented\nin the top one per cent of math achievers, but there are\nalso more of them at the bottom. A 2006 economics study\nshowed universities practicing affi rmative action for men\nso that superior female applicants wouldn’t swamp them.\n“If you were to predict the future on the basis of school\nachievement alone,” Pinker writes, “the world would be\na matriarchy.”\nAnd yet, of course, it is not. Once they move from\nschool to work, men on average earn more money and\nrun more shows. Th ey particularly dominate in national\ngovernment, the corporate boardroom and the science\nlaboratory. Meanwhile, women are more likely to leave\nthe labor force and to end up with lower pay and less authority if they come back.\nPinker, a psychologist and a columnist at Th e Globe\nand Mail in Canada, is careful to remind her readers\nthat statistics say nothing about the choices women and\nmen make individually. Nor does she entirely discount\nthe eff ect of sex discrimination or culture in shaping\nwomen’s choices. But she thinks these forces play only a\nsmall part. To support this, Pinker quotes a female Ivy\nLeague law professor: ”I am very sceptical of the notion\nthat society discourages talented women from becoming scientists,” the professor writes. “My experience,\nat least from the educational phase of my life, is that\nthe very opposite is true.” If women aren’t racing to the\nupper echelons of science, government and the corporate\nworld despite decades of eff orts to woo them, Pinker\nargues, then it must be because they are wired to resist\nthe demands at the top of those fi elds.\nIn her zeal, Pinker veers to the one-sided. She doesn’t\nacknowledge that some of the research cited in her footnotes is either highly questionable as social science or has\nnever been replicated. Pinker omits the work of scientists\nwho have shown that sex-based brain diff erences pale in\ncomparison to similarities. We shouldn’t wish the role of\nsex diff erences away because they’re at odds with feminist\ndogma. But that doesn’t mean we should settle for the\nreductionist version of the relevant science, even if the\ncomplexity doesn’t make for as neat a package between\nhard covers.\nPinker also skips past an answer to the book’s central\nquestion that may have more explanatory power than her\nother arguments, even if it’s more prosaic and familiar to\nmany a parent. Boys lag dramatically behind girls in terms\nof psychological development and physical resilience and\nthen start to catch up as teenagers, as a long-running and\nwell-known study Pinker cites documented. Maybe after\na few years as girls’ developmental equals, boys are ready\nto compete in the work force – and then zoom ahead\nas cultural norms and discrimination push women back.\nAfter all, why would girls’ hard-wired predilection against\ncompetition stay on ice while they blithely sweep all the\nacademic honors and then kick in only at work?\nPinker may not convey all the complexity that goes\ninto making many men’s and women’s lives diff erent,\nbut she has a good prescription for helping more of us\nbe our best selves.\nEmily Bazelon, The New York Times Book Review", "id": ""}
