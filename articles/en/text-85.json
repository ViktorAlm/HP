Mann\nGlobalisation is commonly seen as a distinctly modern\nstate of the world, resulting from air travel and free trade.\nIn 1493, Charles Mann shows this is not so – we have been\ninterconnected for a very long time indeed.\nOur perception of a local and pristine bygone world is\nin fact an imagined version of the past. Trade and exchange\nhave linked Europe and the Americas since Europeans first\nsailed beyond their shores. In this wonderfully entertaining and subtly balanced book, Mann traces some of these\nlinkages, telling familiar stories mixed with fascinating\nnew takes.\nPlants are a familiar example of one such link. Of all\nthe things that have moved with people around the world,\nfood and drug plants top the list. We take our ideas of\nthe world for granted – how could there be Chinese or\nIndian cooking without chilli peppers, or Irish stew without potatoes? But these plants came from the Americas,\nand relatively recently at that – post-1493!\nMann focuses on the chains forged by the Spanish galleon trade, largely because Spain was the first European\ncountry to have a truly global enterprise. People, plants\nand minerals all travelled around the world in a complex\nweb, with fascinating cause and effect – from the collapse\nof the Chinese Qing dynasty to the Irish potato famine\nto the translocation of millions of African people to the\nAmericas as part of the slave trade. One might quibble\nthat other narratives of exploitation and trade are ignored,\nbut this focus allows Mann to explore the ramifications of\nactions in a more detailed way.\nColonisation of the Americas has previously been contrasted by degree of exploitation – the English went to cultivate and the Spanish to extract. But Mann convincingly\npaints a picture of extraction by all European colonists,\nwhether exhausting the land along the eastern seaboard\nof what is now the US by planting tobacco or by mining\nsilver in the Bolivian Andes.\nMann also explores how the flood of silver from Bolivian mines into Europe not only caused financial volatility\nand ultimately the bankruptcy of the Spanish state, but\nalso fuelled unrest in China. Using material from recently\navailable archives, the story of China’s interactions with\nEurope enriches the narrative.\nThe complexities of interconnections are in essence the\ntheme of the book, and nowhere is this more apparent\nthan in the discussion of the iniquitous trade in humans,\nwhich completely changed our species. What makes this\nbook compulsive reading is not the stance it takes, but\ninstead the detailed humanity with which Mann tells the\nstory, and the way in which he illustrates the paradoxical\nnature of the ecological effects linking the world. What\nour ancestors did had unexpected effects; what we do\ntoday will, too.\nSandra Knapp, New Scientist", "id": ""}
