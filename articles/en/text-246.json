Millions of women have probably swooned over\nhim; men have envied his courage, his courtliness – and\nthe fact that in the last reel he gets the girl, who happens to be Ingrid Bergman. Katz was the model for the\nheroic Czech freedom fighter Victor Lazlo in the classic\nfilm Casablanca.\nIn the movie, Lazlo flies off amid the fog to continue\nthe struggle against the Nazis. There is also a shroud of\nfog surrounding Katz. Playboy, charmer, intellectual, spy,\nStalinist, sophisticated conman, fabulist, a man of at least\na dozen aliases – in an age of tragic drama, Katz, by any\nstandards, lived a life of extraordinary excitements, intrigue and adventure. He was at the centre of so many decisive moments of the last century, and as a propagandist\nhe helped to form public opinion about events such as the\nrise of Hitler, the Spanish Civil War and the Holocaust.\nKatz was a quintessential central European of the last\ncentury, at home in many capitals, several languages,\nand numerous bedrooms. He was born in the 1890s in\nBohemia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As\na German-speaking Czech Jew, he was used to living with\nmultiple identities. He grew up in bourgeois ease and\ncomfort, but became a fervent socialist early on, radicalised by the First World War and particularly the rise of\nanti-Semitism after the defeat of the Central Powers. He\njoined the Communist Party, which became the cause he\nlived for throughout the rest of his life – and eventually\ndied for.\nHe moved in avant-garde intellectual circles and relocated to Berlin, where he worked for the leftist theatre\nproducer Erwin Piscator, an impresario who launched the\ncareer of Bertolt Brecht. Katz was almost as committed\nto glamour and sexual conquest as he was to MarxismLeninism. Among his lovers in 1920s Berlin was Marlene\nDietrich.\nKatz was recruited into the Russian intelligence service,\nthe NKVD, and over the next few years he was a propagandist of flair and near genius, using popular journalism\nto further the interests of the organisation Communist\nInternational (Comintern). This was when he began to\nadopt the myriad aliases and noms de plume under which\nhe would write, broadcast on radio and speak at public\nmeetings. For two years he lived in Moscow, training in\nthe tradecraft of espionage.\nHe returned to Europe as one of the Soviet Union’s\nchief exponents of agitprop. In France he organised a\nhighly effective pro-Communist news agency. In Spain\nhe uncovered atrocities committed by Franco’s forces. In\nEngland he hobnobbed among potential leftist supporters\nand spying for the NKVD on the British Establishment.\nHe moved to America and took Hollywood by storm,\nraising huge amounts of money for anti-fascist causes,\nmost of them fronts for the Communists. After the war\nKatz returned to Czechoslovakia, but at the moment of\ntriumph for his cause his own story turned tragic. Stalin\nand his stooges in Prague distrusted a cosmopolitan who\nhad slept with film stars in Hollywood.\nMiles has a good story to tell, but his problem is that\nhe claims too much for it. Of course Katz was an ‘agent’\nin the sense that he worked for the Comintern and Soviet\ninterests. But Miles cannot entirely substantiate the more\ndramatic cloak-and-dagger, James Bond-type material in\nthe book. It is full of suppositions and speculations. Was\nKatz a ‘super-spy’, as Miles claims? Mostly, by this account,\nhe was a super-spin doctor working for the Soviets, a master of the black arts of propaganda. As Katz’s great friend\nArthur Koestler said, ‘everybody knew Katz was a Communist agent’. So hardly very secret. There are also some\nvery strange judgements, those of a conspiracy theorist\nrather than a serious biographer. The well-known writer\nBen Macintyre has spawned an industry – the real-life spy\nstory. All publishers want a success along the lines of his\nacknowledged book Agent Zigzag. If, like Macintyre, you\ncan spot a good tale, research it meticulously and write\nbeautifully, all well and good. Not everyone can.\nVictor Sebestyen, Literary Review", "id": ""}
