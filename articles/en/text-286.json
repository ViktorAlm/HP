Studies have found that children in kindergarten are already\nforming negative views about science that could cast a shadow across their entire educational careers. When researchers interviewed kindergartners from typical classrooms,\nbarely a third of the children showed any knowledge of\nscience, whether from school or other sources. Many children said that science was for older kids and adults, not kindergartners like them. Ask a room of five-year-olds to draw\na scientist, and you will likely get lots of pictures of whitecoated men in laboratories. Furthermore, even before first\ngrade, fewer girls than boys say they like science.\nIt is perilous to generalize about anything in the U.S.\neducation system – quality varies enormously from classroom to classroom – but science has long been a poor stepchild to mathematics and reading. One report noted that\nscience instruction in the early grades “occurs sporadically\nand rarely engages children in practices that encourage rigorous and reflective science learning.” Science is high on the\nlist of subjects that early-grade teachers feel ill prepared to\nteach. A 2009 study found that bright children in Florida\nended their pre-kindergarten year with significantly lower\nreadiness scores in science than in any other domain.\nOf course, teachers need to make difficult trade-offs in\nthe classroom, where many worthy subjects compete for\nprecious little time. If more science is to be taught in kindergarten, what should be removed to make way for it?\nMaybe nothing. Researchers at Purdue University have\ndeveloped an approach for teaching science in kindergarten\nthat integrates it with language. The combination not only\nmakes science instruction more appealing to teachers who\nare very mindful of language arts core curriculum requirements. It also enhances language learning by providing\nsituations in which written language is used for a genuine\npurpose – recording and reporting predictions and observations – instead of a task devoid of any real context. And the\nkindergartners delight in learning words they would usually\nnever encounter in kindergarten lessons.\nThe Purdue approach, the Scientific Literacy Project,\nintroduces children to the most fundamental idea – that\nscience is about carefully conducted inquiry to learn\nabout the world. The lessons do not depend on expensive equipment or the latest in animations and computer\ngames. Low-tech methods suffice, including experiments\nas simple as seeing if salt will dissolve, reading well-chosen\nnon-fiction books – which many adults mistakenly imagine to be inappropriate or uninteresting to such young\nchildren – and maintaining individual science journals.\nThe researchers found that students participating in\ntheir project showed significant gains relative to those\ntaking traditional classes. The kindergartners readily developed skills related to asking questions, conducting observations and experiments, drawing conclusions and sharing\ntheir findings – and had tremendous fun along the way.\nThe project showed its worth for children of diverse ethnic\nand social backgrounds, and, most interestingly, it eliminated the gender gap in attitudes.\nAn emphasis on “inquiry science” has long been advocated by the National Research Council, whose national science education standards stress science as inquiry\nand grasp of a few fundamental concepts, ahead of the\nmore traditional focus on a wide smattering of content\nknowledge. The approach does, however, depend on the\ninstructors understanding how to carry out inquiry-based\nlessons effectively. The teachers need training in how to\nteach science. It is not enough to give them courses to\nbolster their science content knowledge – or to fast-track\nscience graduates into teaching with insufficient schooling\nin the science of how children learn.\nChildren are natural scientists: not only are they inquisitive and energetic, but they have an instinct for controlled experimentation.\nScientific American", "id": ""}
