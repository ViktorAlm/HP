Now our\ncoatings technology is catching up, and today’s new building no longer has to be tomorrow’s rust-streaked eye-sore.\nGetting Physical\nOver the past decade several studies have underscored the\nlink between physical activity and cognition. In a study at\nthe University of California 5,925 women older than 65 at\nfour different medical centres across the U.S. were recruited. The participants were all free of any physical disability that would limit their ability to walk or pursue other\nphysical activities. The volunteers were also screened to\nensure that they did not have cognitive impairment. The\nresearchers then assessed their physical activity by asking\nthe women how many city blocks they walked and how\nmany flights of stairs they climbed daily and gave them\nquestionnaires to fill out about their levels of participation\nin 33 different physical activities. After six to eight years,\nthe researchers assessed the women’s level of cognitive function. The most active women had a 30 percent lower risk\nof cognitive decline. Interestingly, walking distance was\nrelated to cognition, but walking speed was not. It seems\nthat even moderate levels of physical activity can serve to\nlimit declines in cognition in older adults.", "id": ""}
