What fits best with this description of the ideas of Jean-Baptiste Lamarck?"], "article": "Colic\nColic – defned as inconsolable crying in an otherwise\nhealthy infant for more than three hours a day, for more\nthan three days a week, for three weeks or more – has long\nbeen a puzzle for doctors and an exhausting ordeal for parents. So when Anna Zanin, a pediatrician in Paris, noticed\nthat babies with colic and children with migraine share\ncertain symptoms, she decided to explore a possible association between the two conditions. Her research found\nthat 73 percent of children with migraine were colicky\nbabies compared to 27 percent of controls. While Zanin\nemphasizes that further evidence is needed to determine\nwhether there is a causal link, the numbers suggest that\nmigraine and colic may indeed be related.\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck\nCan mice pass memories down several generations? It\nis a startling proposition, and has duly provoked some\nstrong responses. “Crazy Lamarckian shit,” exclaimed one\nobserver. To many biologists, the dirty word here isn’t the\none you might be thinking: rather, it is the reference to\nJean-Baptiste Lamarck, who in the 18th century contended\nthat traits acquired during life can be passed to the next\ngeneration. As there’s no genetic basis for passing on such\nacquired traits, Lamarck’s mechanism can’t be the basis for\nnatural selection, and so was discredited. Now new work\nsuggests that mice may pass on memories of a dangerous\nsmell. It is, however, based on epigenetics: changes that\ntweak the action of genes, not the genes themselves. So it\nfts with natural selection – and may yet give Lamarck’s\nname a sheen of respectability.", "id": ""}
