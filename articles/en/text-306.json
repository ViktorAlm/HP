With its\nuse of slang and deflating assault on the shibboleth of linguistic as much as racial purity, it became the first novel in\nAfrikaans to win the Noma award for publishing in Africa.\nTriomf’s ironic setting was an eponymous Johannesburg\nsuburb built on the rubble of Sophiatown, a multiracial\nhaven of writers and jazz players bulldozed in the 1950s\nunder grand apartheid. In her second novel, van Niekerk\nshifts further into the Afrikaner heartland, to a farm at\nthe West Cape, to probe more traditional subject matter\nof maids and madams, power and land.\nPublished in 2004 as Agaat, and retitled The Way of\nWomen in Michiel Heyns’s English translation, the novel\nis narrated through the unreliable eyes and memory\nof Milla de Vet, the inheritor of a farm named Grootmoedersdrift, outside the town of Swellendam. Milla, now\n70, lies dying of a wasting disease. Paralysed but for her\nblinking eyelids, she is dependent for even the most intimate bodily functions on another woman, Agaat Lourier.\nTheir intriguingly close yet oddly ambiguous relationship\nis gradually traced back almost 50 years, through Milla’s\nselective reminiscing and jottings from diaries she has kept\nsince her marriage in 1947.\nAgaat, born with a stunted arm on Milla’s mother’s\nestate and abused by the family that rejected her, was\n“saved” at the age of five by the childless Milla and installed on her farm, rather like what is known in Afrikaans as\na hanslam, an orphan or rejected lamb reared by hand. Yet\nas so-called coloured in the baas household, the foundling\nwas neither adopted child nor maid but required to fulfil both roles. The tensions and contradictions in Agaat’s\nposition and the shifting neediness of her madam-cummother are amplified when Milla has a son. Yet Agaat, in a\nconvoluted contest of wills with Milla, subverts her relegation to nanny and uniformed servant by displacing Milla\nin the boy’s affections. “I am a slave but You-are-mine,”\nshe whispers in his ear.\nNot long after democracy arrives in the mid-1990s,\nAgaat faces the prospect of freedom with Milla’s impending death. In less skilled hands, this reversal of power\nseems too literal and contrived. Yet for van Niekerk it\nbecomes not so much a drama of crude playback as a\nminute exploration of intimate relationship corroded by\nunequal power, of enforced assimilation and complex strategies of resistance.\nThe Way of Women combines the stark intensity of a\nremarkable death-bed chamber piece, which nonetheless\ncontains some humour, with a compendious sweep from\n19th-century boom time in the Cape to the Angolan war,\nfrom farming manuals on bovine botulism to embroidery\npatterns and Afrikaans nursery rhymes. The book evokes\nworn images of heroic Boer womenfolk tilling the veld\nand delivering their own infants, while their menfolk go\nfishing and nurse hangovers. Some sections could have\nbeen trimmed, although the novel retains momentum\nand suspense, with surprises withheld till the end. With\nits own forensic take on the pathologies of maids and\nmadams, it offers an understated cautionary tale on inheriting the lessons of the masters – and madams – along\nwith their power.\nMaya Jaggi, The Guardian Weekly", "id": ""}
