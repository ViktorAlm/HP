The prevailing theory maintained that the viruses and mosquitoes\nevolved to live in harmony. But entomologists have found\nquite the opposite to be true. They infected mosquitoes\nwith a test virus and found that the mosquito’s immune\nsystem cut up the pathogen’s genetic material so that the\ninsect did not get sick. In contrast, when the mosquitoes\nwere given a genetically modified version that blocked the\ngene-chopping mechanism, the insects could not mount\nan attack against the invader and died off more than four\ntimes as quickly. The discovery might lead to antivirals\nfashioned to mimic the mosquito’s virus-killing tricks.\nUnpredictability\nUnpredictability is the bane of economists, meteorologists, political pundits and sportswriters. They are always\nin danger of having their discredited forays into futurology flung back in their faces. Yet when reading a historical\nwork it is all too easy to fall into the trap of thinking that\nevents could have taken only one path – that what happened must have happened. Writing with the advantage of\nhindsight, historians tend to depict an inexorable march\nof events leading up to the present.", "id": ""}
