Children and Parents Caution, inhibition and even fearfulness may be healthy – and smart – in a number of environments, but they’re still not characteristics many parents want in their children, especially in a society that lionizes the bold. So it’s common for moms and dads of introverted offspring to press their kids to be more outgoing, lest they end up overlooked in class and later in life. Testing What are we to make of the scientific quality of modern tests of functional proficiency in languages, which has come to play such an important role in immigration policy? Carefully developed and well managed, proficiency tests allow defensible decisions about individuals to be made within existing policy settings. In other words, the tests support the fairness of decisions about individuals, and in terms of fairness, are an improvement on procedures that involved impressionistic evaluations from officers not qualified to make language assessment. This is not to say, though, that these tests are perfect. We can make, however, a distinction between fairness and justice. Even if a test is fair, it may be unjust, if it is used to implement unjust policies. Language testers are currently debating whether their responsibility extends to how tests are used. Whatever position one takes in the theoretical debate, it is clear that a good quality test in scientific and technical terms can disarm criticism of the policies it serves."], ["Vaccines must be protected from the African heat.", "The new meningitis vaccine is most effective in hot climates.", "Earlier meningitis vaccines have been ineffective in Africa.", "A recently developed vaccine is less sensitive to high temperatures.

While a few days may seem trivial, the hardest part of protecting poor countries is often keeping vaccine cold while moving it from electrified cities to villages with no power. In bad years, epidemics during the hot Harmattan winds have killed as many as 25,000 Africans and disabled 50,000 more."]], "questions": ["33.

What is the main news value in this text?"], "article": "Setting Standards\nIn the long list of problems that plague American education, one is primary: what should students learn? For\ndecades, however, this question has baffled people. In an\neducation system run by the 50 states, success is in the eye\nof the beholder. Mississippi has different expectations for\npupils than Massachusetts does. America as a whole has\nfallen behind. In a ranking of 15-year-olds in 30 industrialised countries in 2006, American teenagers came a dismal\n21st in science and 25th in maths.\nNow there is a new drive to set national standards. The\nUS Secretary of Education has offered more than $4 billion in total of federal money to states that pursue certain\nreforms – in particular, adopting standards and assessments that prepare students to compete in a global economy. This gives urgency to an effort already under way: the\nNational Governors Association (NGA) and the Council\nof Chief State School Officers (CCSSO) are in the midst\nof drafting common standards.\nPresident Eisenhower spoke of the need for “national\ngoals” for education as long ago as 1959. But past efforts\nto set such standards have been squashed quickly. In the\nearly 1990s, President George Bush senior supported\nnational standards. The guidelines for teaching history\nwere derided by conservatives as political correctness,\nand the Senate threw them out with a 99–1 vote. In 1997\nAmerica scored pathetic marks in an international maths\nand science test. Germany did too, and was so shocked\nthat it brought in national standards and exams. But\nAmerica floundered. Bill Clinton, when president, proposed a voluntary national test; Congress scrapped the\nidea. An encouraging step came in 2001, when No Child\nLeft Behind (NCLB) determined that schools should be\nheld accountable for how they performed. But NCLB still\nlets states set their own bars for success.\nNow, after years of failure, the push for common standards\nhas new life. NCLB’s reforms were plainly insufficient.\nA chorus of wonks and professors say that bad schools\nwill undermine America’s competitiveness in future. Most\nimportant, the states, in the shape of the governors and\nchief school officers, are leading the effort. Recently the\nNGA and the CCSSO published a report calling for\nreform and now all states except Texas and Alaska have\nsigned on, agreeing to support their plan.\nThe NGA and CCSSO hope to create standards for\nmaths and English that are clear, focused and rigorous.\nDane Linn, the NGA’s education director, explains that\nthe drafters have tried to follow the example of high-performing countries such as Singapore and states such as\nMassachusetts. The first task is to provide standards for\nwhat high-school graduates should know to succeed in\ncollege or the workforce. The draft guidelines for English\ninclude examples of suitable content, such as Jane Austen’s\nPride and Prejudice and a lecture by Toni Morrison. The\nsecond task is to create standards for each grade. Mr Linn\nhopes to present final standards in the near future.\nThere are many difficulties ahead. The standards may\nturn out to be too lax. Some states may reject them. States\nthat do adopt the standards will need to revise curricula,\ntextbooks and the way they train teachers, explains Chester Finn of the Fordham Institute, a conservative thinktank. New standards demand new tests. The stimulus\noffered provides $350 million to develop common assessments, but these may not be ready for years. In the end,\nhowever, American students will at least know where they\nstand, and where they should be going.\nThe Economist", "id": ""}
