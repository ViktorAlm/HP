Minority students, facing bullying or belittlement, argue for the need to protect themselves, to create a safe space. But in creating that space, these advocates risk walling themselves off from the unexpected, albeit sometimes ugly, reality of engaging in pitched debate with people with whom they do not see eye to eye.

The Berlin Conference In many parts of Africa, the atrocity inflicted upon the people by the Berlin Conference of 1884–85, which balkanised the continent, can be seen starkly in how homogeneous ethnic groups were carved up and shoved into two, three, and sometimes even more countries just by the stroke of a European pen. It is something that Africans have had to live with since the day the Berlin Conference ended and the Scramble for Africa began in earnest. Bonobos He started it! Bonobos shriek when attacked. But they produce different sounds depending on whether this happens with or without provocation. This distinction adds evidence to the idea that they sense when others have treated them unfairly. A bystander sometimes intervenes, supporting or consoling the attacked ape. This could mean that bonobos also take into account the fairness of how others are treated, something so far thought to be limited to humans. When one bonobo attacks another, there is sometimes an obvious reason, such as fighting over food. On other occasions it appears unprovoked, and in those cases the scream is longer, more high-pitched and harshersounding. “We think these screams are actually eliciting interventions and help from third parties,” says researcher Zanna Clay. “It probably also inhibits the aggressor from doing it again.” "]], "questions": ["33.

On the practical side, in\nthe 1950s anthropologist Edward T. Hall, Jr., wrote that\nthe rules of social time constitute a “silent language” for a\ngiven culture. The rules might not always be made explicit,\nhe stated, but “they exist in the air… They are either familiar and comfortable or unfamiliar and wrong.”\nMost cultures around the world now have clocks and\ncalendars, uniting the majority of the globe in the same\ngeneral rhythm of time. But that doesn’t mean we all\nmarch to the same beat. Some people feel so rushed by\nthe pace of modern life that they are fighting back with\n“slow food,” while in other societies, people feel little pressure to “manage” their time.\n“One of the beauties of studying time is that it’s a wonderful window on culture,” says Robert V. Levine, a social\npsychologist at California State University, Fresno. “You\nget answers on what cultures value and believe in. You get\na really good idea of what’s important to people.”\nLevine and his colleagues have conducted so-called paceof-life studies in 31 countries. In A Geography of Time, first\npublished in 1997, Levine describes how he ranked the\ncountries by using three measures: walking speed on urban\nsidewalks, how quickly postal clerks could fulfill a request\nfor a common stamp, and the accuracy of public clocks.\nKevin K. Birth, an anthropologist at Queens College,\nhas examined time perceptions in Trinidad. Birth’s 1999\nbook, Any Time Is Trinidad Time: Social Meanings and\nTemporal Consciousness, refers to a commonly used phrase\nto excuse lateness. In that country, Birth observes, “if you\nhave a meeting at 6:00 at night, people show up at 6:45\nor 7:00 and say, ‘Any time is Trinidad time.’” When it\ncomes to business, however, that loose approach to timeliness works only for the people with power. A boss can\nshow up late and toss off “any time is Trinidad time”, but\nunderlings are expected to be more punctual. For them,\nthe saying goes, “time is time.” Birth adds that the tie\nbetween power and waiting time is true for many other\ncultures as well.\nThe nebulous nature of time can make it difficult for\nanthropologists and social psychologists to study. “You\ncan’t simply go into a society, walk up to some poor soul\nand say, ‘Tell me about your notions of time’,” Birth says.\n“People don’t really have an answer to that. You have to\ncome up with other ways to find out.”\nBirth attempted to get at how Trinidadians value time\nby exploring how closely their society links time and\nmoney. He surveyed rural residents and found that farmers – whose days are dictated by natural events, such as\nsunrise – did not recognize the phrases “time is money,”\n“budget your time” or “time management,” even though\nthey had satellite TV and were familiar with Western popular culture. But tailors in the same areas were aware of\nsuch notions. Birth concluded that wage work altered the\ntailors’ views of time. “The ideas of associating time with\nmoney are not found globally,” he says, “but are attached\nto your job and the people you work with.”\nHow people deal with time on a day-to-day basis often\nhas nothing to do with how they conceive of time as an\nabstract entity. “There’s often a disjunction between how\na culture views the mythology of time and how people\nthink about time in their daily lives,” Birth asserts. “We\ndon’t think of Stephen Hawking’s theories as we go about\nour daily lives.”\nZiauddin Sardar, a British Muslim author and critic, has\nwritten about time and Islamic cultures. Muslims “always\ncarry the past with them,” claims Sardar, and asserts that\nthe West has “colonized” time by spreading the expectation that life should become better as time passes: “If you\ncolonize time, you also colonize the future. If you think\nof time as an arrow, of course you think of the future as\nprogress, going in one direction. But different people may\ndesire different futures.”\nScientific American", "id": ""}
